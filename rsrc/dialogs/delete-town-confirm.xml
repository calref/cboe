		You are about to delete the last town in your scenario's town list
		(so if you have 10 towns in your scenario, the tenth will disappear).
		This change will immediately be saved, and can't be undone.

		Make sure to remove all outdoor entrances to the deleted town,
		as well as all references to it in special encounters.
		Failure to do so will result in scenario run-time errors.
