		This scenario was loaded from a legacy file, and as such its custom graphics have not yet been converted.
		They need to be converted before you can edit them in the scenario editor.
		This will automatically happen when you save, but if you prefer, you can convert them now.
		Be aware that the conversion converts white to transparency,
		so it may create unwanted holes if you had terrain or dialog graphics that used pure white.
