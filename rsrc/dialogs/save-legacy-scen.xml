		This scenario is currently set as a legacy scenario, meaning that certain mechanics are changed.
		If you have updated the scenario to account for these changes, then click the Update button

		The following details need to be accounted for before clearing the legacy flag (the presence
		of the flag disables these changes):<br/><br/>
		 ~ The Resurrect spell now requires Resurrection Balm to cast. If this scenario is for
		high level parties, you should make sure that Resurrection Balm is available.<br/>
		 ~ Specials are now called while boating through town. This was automatically fixed when
		you first converted the scenario, but you may want to review any town specials set on
		water just in case.<br/>
		 ~ When special nodes are called in combat, the currently active PC is now selected by default.
		This means that any Affect PC nodes will affect only that PC instead of the whole party.
		You will need to add an explicit Select Target node to select the whole party if you want the
		old behaviour.<br/>
		 ~ Timed events can now be called when the party is resting. If the scenario relied on this not
		happening, it may need to be updated.<br/>
