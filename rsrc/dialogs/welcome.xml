		Blades of Exile is, like most games of its type,
		slightly complicated. Fortunately, there are plenty of
		places to look for help should you get confused. In-game
		hints are available, as well as an instruction manual.
		You can also find playing hints and related discussion
		at the Spiderweb Software game forums.
