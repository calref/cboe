		While playing the game, type 'D'.
		This will put you in Debug Mode.

		When you make a change in a town, before testing it, be sure to leave the town and type '>'.
		This causes the game to forget everything you've done in that town.
		If you don't do this, your corrections may not be remembered properly.

		Finally, if you edit your scenario while playing in it, whenever you save a change go back to the game and reload your save file.
		Otherwise, the game may not read the scenario data properly and crash.
