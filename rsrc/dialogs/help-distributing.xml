		When you've completed your scenario, you probably want to give other people the chance to play through it.
		It's a big kick letting other people run around in your own fantasy world, get stuck at your puzzles, and kill your creations.

		The easiest way to release a scenario is to send it over to Spiderweb Software.
		Go to www.spidweb.com.
		There's a scenario upload area there.
		Alternately, mail it to us on disk (PO Box 85659, Seattle, WA 98145).

		Before you send a scenario, however, be sure to read the License Agreement (in the file Blades of Exile License).
		It says a lot of big no-no's and describes your (and our) rights for your scenario.

		Also look for information on the Blades of Exile Scenario Contest.
		Your scenario, if really good, could win you products or a hefty chunk of money.
		If you think your scenario is good enough, be sure to send it in!

		Finally, if your scenario is really, really good, we might like to sell it as a stand-alone.
		If we're interested, you can actually make money from your work!
		To take a shot at this, just send us your scenario before releasing it.
