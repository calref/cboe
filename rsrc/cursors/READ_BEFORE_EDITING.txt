When editing the GIF files in this folder, you need to be aware how the hotspot is stored.
Each of these GIF files encodes the cursor's hotspot into a GIF comment with the following
syntax (case-sensitive):

	Hotspot(x,y)

where x and y are substituted with the actual integer coordinates. There should be no extra
spaces anywhere in that. (However, anything after the closing parenthesis will be ignored.)

If you edit any of these images, be sure to update the hotspot if necessary!
