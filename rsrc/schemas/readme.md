Blades of Exile New Scenario Format
===================================

This document describes, in as much detail as possible, the format of _.boes_ files. Parts
of the format are specified by the various XSD schemas in this directory, but the schemas
are not a perfect representation of the format - they are a little more restrictive than
the game itself accepts, and omit a few complex restrictions that the game enforces.

The Scenario Package
--------------------

A Blades of Exile scenario is a tarball (ustar) compressed with gzip. The tarball contains
the following files:

* scenario/
	* header.exs - This file has no function except to allow you to open a scenario that
	has been unpacked with the scenario editor. It contains the scenario and Blades of Exile
	version in binary format.
	* scenario.xml - Contains most of the global data for the scenario.
	* scenario.spec - Contains the definitions of the scenario special nodes.
	* terrain.xml - Contains the definitions of scenario terrain types.
	* items.xml - Contains the definitions of scenario items.
	* monsters.xml - Contains the definitions of scenario monsters.
	* towns/
		* town*N*.xml - Contains most of the data for town _N_.
		* town*N*.spec - Contains the definitions of the special nodes for town _N_.
		* town*N*.map - Contains the map data for town _N_.
		* talk*N*.xml - Contains the dialogue nodes associated with town _N_.
	* out/
		* out*X*~*Y*.xml - Contains most of the data for outdoors sector (_X_,_Y_).
		* out*X*~*Y*.spec - Contains the definitions of the special nodes for outdoors
		sector (_X_,_Y_).
		* out*X*~*Y*.map - Contains the map data for outdoors sector (_X_,_Y_).
	* graphics/ - (optional)
		* sheet*X*.png - (optional) Custom graphics sheet ID _X_.
		* «various» (optional) Override the default graphic sheets of the same name.
	* sounds/ - (optional)
		* SND*X*.wav - (optional) A custom sound with ID _X_. If _X_ < 100, the sound will
		override the default sound with the same ID.
	* dialogs/ - (optional) - Contains complex dialog definitions used by the scenario.
	This is currently unused.

If you have a _scenario_ directory with the proper structure, it can be turned into a
valid scenario with the following shell command:

	tar -zcf scenname.boes scenario

(This should work on the Windows command-line too, assuming you have `tar.exe` installed
and in the `%PATH%` or current directory.)

Special Nodes
-------------

Scenario special nodes are stored in _.spec_ files in a special "pseudo-assembly" format.
The grammar is as follows:

	«node-file» -> («comment» | «const-def» [«comment»] | «node-def» [«comment»])*
	«const-def» -> def «identifier» = «integer»
	«node-def» -> @«opcode» [= «integer»] «data-def»*
	«data-def» -> «data-def-unary» | «data-def-binary» | «data-def-ternary»
	«data-def-unary» -> goto = «value»
	«data-def-binary» -> (sdf | pic) = «value» [, «value»]
	«data-def-ternary» -> (msg | ex1 | ex2) = «value» [, «value» [, «value»]]
	«value» -> «integer» | «identifier»

An `«identifier»` is a sequence of letters, underscores, hyphens, and dollar signs (digits
not permitted). An `«integer»` is a sequence of digits. An `«opcode»` is a special
identifier; valid opcodes are listed in the file
[specials-opcodes.txt](../strings/specials-opcodes.txt).
In addition, `nop` is also a valid opcode.

A `«comment»` is any sequence of characters starting with the `#` character and ending
with a newline.

Note that, although the format supports defined constants using `def`, the scenario editor
never writes defined constants.

Map Data
--------

Map data is stored in _.map_ files in a two-dimensional format. Each line in the file
represents one row of terrain in the town or outdoor sector. Individual tiles within a
single row are comma-separated. A tile consists of an integer, giving the terrain type on
that space, followed by an optional set of modifiers. Most modifiers consist of a special
character followed by an integer. A few modifiers consist of only a special character.
There can be multiple modifiers of the same type on a single tile.

The list of valid tile modifiers follows:

* `^ < > v` - Gives the position of a town entrance from one specific direction. (The
fourth one there is lowercase V.) Takes no argument. Only valid in town.
* `*` - Specifies that the tile is a wandering monster arrival point. Argument is which
point (0-3).
* `:` - Indicates a special node is attached to the space. Argument is the node number.
* `!` - Indicates a sign is attached to the space. Argument is which sign.
* `@` - When used outdoors, indicates a town entrance; argument is the town number. When
used in town, indicates a placed item; argument is the index of the placed item entry.
* `&` - Indicates an overlay such as a field, object, or special spot. The argument is a
number indicating the type of field (valid values are listed below). It can be used
outdoors, but the only valid argument is `9`, indicating a special spot.
* `$` - When used in town, indicates a placed creature; argument is the index of the
placed creature entry. When used outdoors, indicates a placed special encounter group;
argument is the index of the special encounter. (Note: Placed outdoor special encounters
are not yet supported.)
* `h` - Indicates a horse that belongs to the party. Argument is the index of the horse in
the global list.
* `H` - As above, except the horse does not belong to the party.
* `b` - Indicates a boat that belongs to the party. Argument is the index of the boat in
the global list.
* `B` - As above, except the boat does not belong to the party.

General XML notes
-----------------

All XML documents used in the scenario format require a `boes` attribute on their root
node, which should be set to `2.0.0`. This is a way to indicate the _format version_; if
the format ever changes, the value of this attribute will also be changed.

Some elements that contain text content are automatically wrapped in a `CDATA` declaration
by the scenario editor. The rest are never wrapped in a `CDATA` declaration. As a result,
while the game will correctly load `CDATA` declarations in any text element, it's only
safe to use them in elements where the scenario editor would use one.

There are some types that are common:

* Booleans - a boolean is one of the strings "`true`" or "`false`".
* Points - a point is an element with two attributes, `x` and `y`. It has no content.
* Rects - a rect is an element with four attributes: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right`.
It has no content
* Timers - a timer is an element whose content is the number of the node to call, with an
attribute `freq` specifying how many moves to wait between calls.

coordinates of the section) store most of the data for a single outdoor sector. The root
element is `<sector>`, and the following toplevel tags are allowed:

* `<name>` - (required) The name of the outdoor sector.
* `<comment>` - A comment on the sector for the scenario designer (only seen in the
editor).
* `<sound>` - The ambient sound that is occasionally played while wandering through the
sector. May be an integer sound ID or one of the special values `birds` or `drip`.
* `<encounter>`, `<wandering>` - (max 4 of each) An outdoors encounter. These are
identical in structure; the only difference is that `<wandering>` encounters will
occasionally be spawned at the wandering encounter arrival points, while `<encounter>` is
spawned by a special node. Allows the following attributes and subtags:
	* `can-flee=` - A boolean indicating whether the encounter is permitted to flee if the
	party is too strong.
	* `<monster>` - (required, max 10) Specifies one of the monsters in this encounter.
	How many of this monster spawn is determined by the position of this `<monster>`
	element relative to the other `<monster>` elements. This supports a boolean `friendly`
	attribute.	You can have at most 3 with `friendly="true"` and at most 7 with
	`friendly="false"` (the	default).
	* `<onmeet>` - A special node to call when the encounter starts.
	* `<onwin>` - A special node to call when the encounter is beaten.
	* `<onflee>` - A special node to call when the party flees the encounter.
	* `<sdf>` - The SDF to prevent the encounter, as a point.
* `<sign>` - (max unbounded) The text of a particular sign. Requires an `id` attribute to
specify which sign it applies to. The scenario editor wraps the contents of this element
in a `CDATA` declaration.
* `<area>` - (max unbounded) The definition of an area description rect. This is a rect
type, but it also contains the area name as its content.
* `<string>` - (max unbounded) A string for use by outdoor special nodes. Requires an `id`
attribute to specify which string it is. The scenario editor wraps the contents of this
element in a `CDATA` declaration.

Town Header
-----------

The _town**N**.xml_ files (where **N** is substituted with number of the town) store most
of the data for a single town. The root element is `<town>`, and the following toplevel
tags are allowed:

`64`.
* `<name>` - (required) The town name.
* `<comment>` - (max 3) A comment on the town for the scenario designer (only seen in the

* `<lighting>` - (required) The town's lighting type. Must be one of `lit`, `dark`,
`drains`, `none`.
* `<onenter>` - (max 2) A special node to call when the party enters this town. It can
have a `condition` attribute which can be either `alive` (the default) or `dead`.
* `<exit>` - (max 4) A point at which the party will end up at when exiting the town in
the direction indicated by the `dir` attribute (which can be one of `n`, `e`, `w`, `s`).

direction indicated by the `dir` attribute.
* `<onoffend>` - A special node to call when the player makes the town hostile.
* `<timer>` - (max 8) A town timer.
* `<flags>` - (required) Several town flags, mostly booleans. Supports the following
subtags:
	* `<chop>` - Information about how the town dies, given in the attributes `day`,
	`event`, (which work together to determine if it dies) and `kills` (which is a
	separate check).
	* `<hidden>`
	* `<strong-barriers>`
	* `<defy-mapping>`
	* `<defy-scrying>`

	* `<onkill>` - A special node to call when this creature dies.
	* `<ontalk>` - A special node to call when attempting to talk to this creature.

Conversations
-------------

The _talk**N**.xml_ files (where **N** is substituted with number of the town) store most
of the dialogue for a single town. The root element is `<dialogue>`. It contains up to 10
`<personality>` subtags, followed by any number of `<node>` subtags.

The `<personality>` element requires the following subtags:
* `<title>` - The name of the person.
* `<look>` - The person's response to "look". The scenario editor wraps the contents of
this element in a `CDATA` declaration.
* `<name>` - The person's response to "name". The scenario editor wraps the contents of
this element in a `CDATA` declaration.
* `<job>` - The person's response to "job". The scenario editor wraps the contents of this
element in a `CDATA` declaration.
* `<unknown>` - The person's response when they don't have a response. The scenario editor
wraps the contents of this element in a `CDATA` declaration.

A `<personality>` element requires an `id` subtag with a value in the closed interval
[10*N*, 10(*N* + 1) - 1], where _N_ is the town number encoded into the filename. 

The `<node>` element requires the following subtags:
* `<keyword>` - (max 2) A four-letter keyword that triggers this node.
* `<type>` - The type of node, as a string. For a list of valid values, search for
eTalkNode in [estreams.cpp](../../src/classes/estreams.cpp).
* `<param>` - (optional, max 4) These elements specify, in order, the A, B, C, D
parameters of the node.
* `<text>` - (max 2) One text response string.  The scenario editor wraps the contents of
this element in a `CDATA` declaration.

A `<node>` element requires a `for` subtag which must either reference the `id` subtag on
a `<personality>` element in the same file or contain one of the values `-1` or `-2`. Note
that a node with `for="-1"` is an unused node which is usually stripped out when saving
(unless it contains at least one non-empty `<text>`).

Custom Dialogs
--------------

There's a detailed description of the dialog format [here](../../src/doxy/mainpage.md).
However, when support for custom dialogs is actually implemented, there will probably be
additional restrictions, which will then be documented here.

Custom Sounds and Graphics
--------------------------

You can include custom graphics sheets by naming the files _sheet**X**.png_, where **X**
is an integer starting from 0. There are two types of custom graphics sheets. The first
contiguous range of sheets are taken as _primary sheets_ and used for locating arbitrary
custom graphics. Any additional sheets are only accessible as _full sheets_ in a Display
Picture special node. Primary sheets should always be 280x360; full sheets can be any size
you like.

For example, if you have the following files in the _graphics/_ subdirectory of the
scenario package:
- sheet0.png
- sheet1.png
- sheet2.png
- sheet10.png

Then you have access to custom graphics slots 0-299 (0-99 on _sheet0.png_, 100-199 on
_sheet1.png_, 200-299 on _sheet2.png_), but you can't reference custom graphics slots
1000-1099, even though you have a _sheet10.png_. However, you can reference sheet 10
directly in a Display Picture special node.

You can also override preset graphics by putting a file in the _graphics/_ directory whose
name exactly matches one of the preset graphics files. The following preset graphics
sheets can currently be overridden by including a file with the same name inside the
scenario package:
- objects.png
- tinyobj.png
- fields.png
- trim.png
- booms.png
- missiles.png
- dlogpics.png
- staticons.png
- teranim.png
- talkportraits.png
- pcs.png
- vehicle.png
- termap.png

You can include custom sounds by naming the files _SND**X**.png_, where **X** is an
integer starting from 0. Sounds with IDs 0-99 will override the preset sound of the same
ID, so usually you'll want to start your sounds at ID 100. The scenario editor won't allow
you to add sounds with IDs less than 100.
