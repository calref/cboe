Alchemy and Poison
30
Alchemy can be incredibly useful. Potions can give you the added boost you may need to get through a long grueling dungeon, and you cannot raise the dead without the right concoction.
You need three things to make a potion:|1. High alchemy skill. When a character tries to make a potion, their alchemy skill must be above a certain level. The higher above that level, the better the chance for success.
2. The right ingredient. Ingredients are usually found at special encounters outdoors, and regenerate themselves after a time. Generally, the person who teaches a recipe tells you what plant it needs.
3. The recipe. These are usually bought in towns. You only need to buy each recipe once for the entire party.
When you have all these things, go into a town and click on the blue bottle button. Pick the PC with the highest alchemy skill to make the potion. Hope.

One of the most useful things you can make with alchemy is poison, a powerful weapon in the magic-poor world of Exile.
Many monsters are immune to magic and fire. However, not many are poison-resistant. This makes poison an excellent mage-killer.
To poison a weapon, use it during combat. Your hand-to-hand weapon (the first one, if two are equipped) or arrows will become poisoned. Each time you attack, the level of poison decreases.
Don't poison a weapon too long before combat. It's effectiveness decreases with time. Also, switching weapons makes the poison disappear.
Poisoning an already poisoned weapon doesn't do much good. The weapon gets the maximum poison level of the poison being added or the poison already there, no more.
