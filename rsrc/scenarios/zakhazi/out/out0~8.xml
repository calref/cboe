        <![CDATA[Sure enough, the moment you enter the cavern, the snakes rise up as one and start slithering towards you. The synchronized behavior is bizarre, until you notice that several of the snakes are unusually large. And have human heads.]]>

        <![CDATA[You feel a slight draft. It's not moist and cool, as expected. Instead, it's warm, and there is a hint of sulphur in the air. As you look around to see where the sulphur came from, you hear a roar. There are hydras nearby.]]>

        <![CDATA[Few, however, flaunt their magical nature are much as this tiny pool. The water has many small chips of mica suspended in it, which flicker and catch the light, and the air around the pool has the pronounced smell of mint.]]>
