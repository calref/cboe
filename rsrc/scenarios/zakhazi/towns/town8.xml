    <string id="1">
        <![CDATA[She extends a skeletal hand and mutters a few powerful words. A huge scroll appears in front of you, floating in midair. "This scroll is very old, and tell the history of many dragons. It's a rare, fairly valuable piece of scholarship."]]>

    <string id="2">
        <![CDATA["Of course, as interesting as this item can be, there are many other things I can do for you. If you wish, instead of the scroll, I can tell you the location of a priceless gemstone, which can easily buy your passage through the northern caverns."]]>

        <![CDATA["Would you like this information instead of the scroll?"]]>

    <string id="6">
        <![CDATA[The scroll disappears. "Excellent," Morog says. "There is a tunnel to the east of my fortress, which leads to an outpost of stranded Empire soldiers."]]>

        <![CDATA["In that outpost is the Melora Opal, a massive, priceless stone that will serve you very well in trying to leave the caverns to the north. That is all. You may go."]]>

    <string id="9">

    <string id="17">
        <![CDATA[You return to the skull totems. The stone platform you found the statue on is still here and still bare. You suddenly feel a strange, nearly overwhelming compulsion to replace the statue. Do you?]]>

    <string id="23">
        <![CDATA[You replace the statue. You suddenly feel much better. A strange weight has been lifted from your shoulders. You feel rejuvenated.]]>

    <string id="26">
        <![CDATA[Although this cavern seems natural, populated only by mindless creatures and missing the touch of intelligent beings, it clearly has not always been that way. This small alcove contains some sort of sinister shrine.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="27">
        <![CDATA[There are eight totems, arranged in a circle. They're quite old, hundreds of years, and yet mold and decay have barely affected the carved cavewood. At the top of each is the skull of a humanoid. You aren't sure of the species, though they had fangs.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="28">
        <![CDATA[In the middle of the circle is a stone pedestal. Sitting on the pedestal is an intricate, carved statuette. It is of a strange, tentacled monster, carved of malachite and about nine inches high.]]>

    <string id="29">
        <![CDATA[Although it's not exactly pretty, it is a fascinating artifact. Someone somewhere would be sure to pay good money for it.]]>

    <string id="32">
        <![CDATA[You carefully pick up the statue and put it into your pack. When you do, the feeling of dread which afflicted you when you approached this tunnel returns in full force. ]]>
    </string>
    <string id="33">
        <![CDATA[Suddenly, it seems as if the skulls are staring at you, and you feel ill and shaky. Cramps shoot across your abdomens, and sweat breaks out on your foreheads. You can still move, but with difficulty. You leave the circle.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="34">
        <![CDATA[This cavern contains a small, tranquil pool, fed by a slow, natural spring. The water looks clear, inviting, and relatively algae free.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="40">
        <![CDATA[You drink the water. It fills you with a gentle, pleasant, relaxed feeling.]]>

        <![CDATA[The feeling of tranquility passes. You feel agitated again.]]>
    </string>

        <![CDATA[You reach a circle of grim totems, covered with skulls, bones, and grisly trophies of the slain. The poles are covered with mold and have clearly been here for quite some time. Strangely, being near them makes you feel very uncomfortable.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="43">
        <![CDATA[However, the tranquil feeling you got from the drinking from the cave pool is still with you, and you are able to walk among the totems with only mild discomfort.]]>

        <![CDATA[The closer you get to the totems, the worse they make you feel. It's as if the skulls were staring at you, and, for a moment, you think they're whispering to you as well. You back away.]]>

    <string id="46">
        <![CDATA[Suddenly, the statue starts to feel extremely heavy in your pack. You look out the tunnel into the larger cave beyond and start to feel extremely agoraphobic. You turn back. As you do, you feel ill.]]>

    <string id="49">
        <![CDATA[Your knowledge of cave lore pays off. You recognize several of the mushrooms in this alcove. They're a very rare variety which is reputed to have great healing properties. Several of them are ripe and ready for plucking.]]>
