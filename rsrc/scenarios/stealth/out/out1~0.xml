        <![CDATA[Their commander approaches you, smirking, and says "We're guarding this road. Anyone passing must pay a 10 gold toll. Let's have it." As he says it, the other soldiers laugh. It's not friendly laughter.]]>

    <string id="27">
        <![CDATA[The soldiers are taken aback. The idea of someone refusing their bullying simply has not occurred to them. As they mutter back and forth about what to do, you notice that none of them have their insignia on their armor.]]>

    <string id="28">
        <![CDATA[When an Empire soldier is kicked out of the army, the insignia is the first thing torn from him or her. When they see that you've noticed this, they have no choice but to attack.]]>

        <![CDATA[You come across a large hut. It's about two stories high, and in good condition. You would think that it would be very difficult to eke out a living out here in the middle of this enormous swamp, but someone is managing.]]>

        <![CDATA[When you get close, they come out and block the road. Their captain says "Sorry. This area is restricted now. It's a 10 gold toll to pass. Let's have it." As he says it, his troops snicker behind him.]]>

    <string id="51">
        <![CDATA[You refuse to pay this extortion. As they quietly discuss amongst themselves what to do, you notice that their armor doesn't have its shoulder insignia. When an Empire soldier is booted out, the first thing they do is strip off their insignia!]]>
