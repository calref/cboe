Graphics Credits
================

This is just a list of where all the graphics in this folder came from. In many cases,
graphics will be referenced by their index as understood by the game; usually this is
counted across first and then down, but in a few cases (like animated terrain or monsters)
you count down and then across.

The following files consist solely of original BoE graphics primarily by Andrew Hunter,
though in some cases rearranged a little:

In booms.png, the last two rows and the right-most graphic on the first row are by ADoS.
The yellow explosion is a simple invert of the blue one. The rest are original BoE.

In fields.png, the first four graphics were created by ADoS.
The rest are original BoE graphics.

Some sheets are entirely original:

- dlogscroll.png created by Jewels (pressed versions made by Celtic Minstrel)

For terrain graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following (some of
which are based on original BoE graphics):

- On ter5.png, graphics 20-23 and 33 are by Mistb0rn. Graphics 18, 19, 25 are by ADoS.
Graphics 24 and 46-49 were monster graphics in original BoE.
- ter6.png is entirely by Mistb0rn.
- ter7.png is by Mistb0rn, except the small trees (54 and 46) which are by Celtic
Minstrel.
- On ter8.png, graphics 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16 are by Celtic Minstrel; 18, 19, 44-49
are by ADoS, and the rest are by Mistb0rn.
- ter9.png is entirely by ADoS (some based on original BoE graphics).
- On ter10.png, the base ice tiles (graphics 1 and 2) are by Mistb0rn and the rest is by
ADoS (based on those tiles and original BoE graphics) with some tweaks by Celtic Minstrel.
- ter11.png and ter12.png are entirely by ADoS.
- On teranim.png, graphic 15 is by Mistb0rn and graphic 16 is by ADoS.
- termap.png currently just contains directly shrunken versions of the other sheets.

For monster graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following (some of
which are based on original BoE graphics):

- The last graphic in monst5.png (the statue) is adapted from Exile III (though BoE had a
nearly-identical one).
- The last graphic in monst7.png (the red slime) is by ADoS.
- The crystal souls in monst8.png have been modified from the original to remove the
background flooring.

For item graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following:

- The last two rows of objects.png are by ADoS, as is graphic 17.
- On tinyobj.png, graphics 17, 45-54, and 134-138 are by ADoS.

startanim.png has been heavily modified by ADoS with new text, but the actual pictures
in it are still all original BoE graphics.

In staticons.png, the last four rows are by ADoS, some with tweaks by Celtic Minstrel.
The rest are original BoE graphics.

Most of edbuttons.png is by ADoS. A few of the tiny icons are by Celtic Minstrel or
unchanged from original BoE. Most of the palette buttons are based on original BoE or on
buttons by Celtic Minstrel (some of which were themselves based on original BoE). The
blue button is unchanged from original BoE; the + button is by Celtic Minstrel.
