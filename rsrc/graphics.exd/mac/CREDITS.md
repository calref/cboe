Graphics Credits
================

This is just a list of where all the graphics in this folder came from. In many cases,
graphics will be referenced by their index as understood by the game; usually this is
counted across first and then down, but in a few cases (like animated terrain or monsters)
you count down and then across.

The following files consist solely of original BoE graphics, though in some cases
rearranged a little:

- actionhelp.png
- bigscenpics.png (except the fourth which is by The Almighty Doer of Stuff)
- booms.png (the yellow explosion is a simple invert of the blue one)
- buttons.png
- dlgbtnred.pm
- dlogbtnhelp.png
- dlogbtnled.png
- dlogbtnlg.png

In fields.png, the first four graphics were created by ADoS.
The rest are original BoE graphics.

Some sheets are entirely original:

- dlogscroll.png created by Jewels (pressed versions made by Celtic Minstrel)

For terrain graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following:

- On ter5.png, graphics 20-23 and 33 are by Mistb0rn. Graphic 25 is by ADoS.
- termap.png is currently out-of-date.

For monster graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following:

- The last graphic in monst5.png (the statue) is adapted from Exile III (though BoE had a
nearly-identical one).
- The last graphic in monst7.png (the red slime) is by ADoS.
- The crystal souls in monst8.png have been modified from the original to remove the
background flooring.

For item graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following:

- The last row of objects.png are by ADoS, as is graphic 17.
- On tinyobj.png, graphics 17 and 45-49 are by ADoS.

startanim.png has been heavily modified with new text, but the actual pictures in it are
still all original BoE graphics.

In staticons.png, the last three rows (except the blue M shield) are from Blades of Avernum.
The rest are original BoE graphics.
