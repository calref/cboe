Graphics Credits
================

This is just a list of where all the graphics in this folder came from. In many cases,
graphics will be referenced by their index as understood by the game; usually this is
counted across first and then down, but in a few cases (like animated terrain or monsters)
you count down and then across.

The following files consist solely of original BoE graphics, though in some cases
rearranged a little:
