Graphics Credits
================

This is just a list of where all the graphics in this folder came from. In many cases,
graphics will be referenced by their index as understood by the game; usually this is
counted across first and then down, but in a few cases (like animated terrain or monsters)
you count down and then across.

The following files consist solely of original BoE graphics, though in some cases
rearranged a little:

- actionhelp.png
- bigscenpics.png (except the fourth which is by The Almighty Doer of Stuff)

In fields.png, the first four graphics were created by ADoS.
The rest are original BoE graphics.

The buttons in edbuttons.png were created by ADoS. Some were based on original BoE
buttons, some were based on buttons by Celtic Minstrel (some of which were themselves
based on original BoE buttons), and some are original. The tiny icons are either original
BoE or created by Celtic Minstrel (some based on the originals).

Some sheets are entirely original:

- dlogscroll.png created by Jewels (pressed versions made by Celtic Minstrel)

For terrain graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following (some of
which are based on original BoE graphics):

- On ter5.png, graphics 20-23 and 33 are by Mistb0rn. Graphics 18, 19, 25 are by ADoS.
Graphics 24 and 46-49 were monster graphics in original BoE.
- ter6.png is entirely by Mistb0rn.
- ter7.png is by Mistb0rn, except the small trees (54 and 46) which are by Celtic
Minstrel.
- On ter8.png, graphics 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16 are by Celtic Minstrel; 48 and 49 are
by
Wyrmfire; 18 and 19 are by ADoS; and the rest are by Mistb0rn.
- ter9.png is entirely by Wyrmfire.
- On ter10.png, graphics 0-5, 8-19 are by Wyrmfire, and the rest are by Mistb0rn (but
based
on Wyrmfire's graphics).
- On ter11.png, graphics 0-22 are by Mistb0rn.
- On teranim.png, graphic 15 is by Mistb0rn and graphic 16 is by Wyrmfire.
- termap.png currently just contains directly shrunken versions of the other sheets.

For monster graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following (some of
which are based on original BoE graphics):

- The last graphic in monst5.png (the statue) is adapted from Exile III (though BoE had a
nearly-identical one).
- The last graphic in monst7.png (the red slime) is by ADoS.
- The crystal souls in monst8.png have been modified from the original to remove the
background flooring.

For item graphics, most are original BoE graphics, except for the following:

- The last row of objects.png are by ADoS, as is graphic 17.
- On tinyobj.png, graphics 17 and 45-49 are by ADoS.

startanim.png has been heavily modified with new text, but the actual pictures in it are
still all original BoE graphics.

In staticons.png, the last three rows (except the blue M shield) are from Blades of
Avernum.
The rest are original BoE graphics.
