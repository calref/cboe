        <![CDATA[You draw your weapons, but then realize that the people above you aren't preparing to attack. Instead, one of them gives you a sharp salute. Then, in mere moments, they're all gone.]]>

    <string id="35">
        <![CDATA[The ogres have piled lots of smelly trash and rancid meat here. Unpleasant, feral creatures have taken up residence, living it up on their debris. Monster etiquette, of course, demands that they attack you.]]>

        <![CDATA[A lot of ogres are up here, ready to throw rocks on people coming up the path below. The are quite put out to find that you've flanked them. They rush to attack.]]>

        <![CDATA[The ogre tribe destroyed, their loot is laid out for the taking. You leave the questionable meat behind, instead filling your packs with all manner of gold and trade goods.]]>

    <string id="42">
        <![CDATA[Oddly, they haven't attacked yet. Their chief seems to he holding them back. Perhaps, for once, some monsters are showing respect for your abilities. If you want, you can attack them. Or, you could just leave.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you walk away, one of the ogres shouts an insult at you. Fortunately, it's in ogrish, so you can't understand it.]]>

    <string id="48">
        <![CDATA[Oops. That's why they were waiting. They wanted to buy some time, so their mages could cast spells while you charged. The world begins to speed up around you. Then the ogres attack.]]>

    <string id="49">
        <![CDATA[The ogres keep their pets in caves down here. They must feed them by sending prisoners to walk up this path. At least, that's what all the gnawed bones suggest to you.]]>

        <![CDATA[The ogres must love their pet bears very much. Each one wears a collar, and each collar has a semi-precious stone set into it. This expedition suddenly became very profitable.]]>
