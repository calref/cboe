        <![CDATA["A small reward is in the chest in the corner. Don't poke around this hideout for other goodies ... it's been trapped. Get out of here. Go instead to meet your next contact. Her name is Luna, and she is in the city of Buzzard.]]>

        <![CDATA[When they see you, they are relieved. Their investigation might net some victims after all. They draw their swords, and advance. Trying to explain anything about who you are does no good - these soldiers want blood, and nothing else.]]>

        <![CDATA[Unfortunately, the note wasn't lying when it said this place was booby trapped. The Hill Runners don't take half measures, either. One of their explosive devices was placed inside this chest, and went off before you even got near it.]]>

        <![CDATA[Soon after, there is an explosion, so massive you can even feel it where you're standing. With a mighty cloud of dust, the outpost caves in. Yet another pile of bodies in this insane war.]]>

        <![CDATA[That's odd. The rebels were incredibly thorough in stripping this place clean, and yet, in this secret room, they left a closed chest behind. Very odd indeed.]]>
