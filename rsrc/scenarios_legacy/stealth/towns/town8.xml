    <string id="1">
        <![CDATA[The floor of this chamber is littered with broken ogre bodies. Bloody tracks leading to the south, however, indicate that not all of the ogres died in the fall. Some other unpleasant fate must have awaited them.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you make your way down the dark tunnel, there's one thing you notice before anything else: it's cold! That's to be expected to some extent in any system of caves, but this is unnatural. The walls and floor are covered with ice.]]>

    </string>
    <string id="6">
        <![CDATA[It says "Ah! So yet another group of pitiful ogres has been sent to amuse me. Do not fear, little ogrelings. Do not concern yourselves. Your death is assured. There is no need to waste your energy on fear."]]>

    <string id="23">
        <![CDATA[The voice is starting to grow annoyed. "Now I am truly surprised by your progress. Surprised and angered. I see now I should have not put my valuable pets at risk, even to a bumbling group of ogres."]]>

    <string id="38">
        <![CDATA[When the fearsome blue creature sees you enter his cavern, it rears up, ready to breathe doom upon you. However, when it gets a good look at you, it lowers its forelegs to the ground, and looks at you, confused.]]>

        <![CDATA["Oh, this is amusing," it chortles. "All this time I though you were just another ogre sacrifice that got lucky, and here you are, a fully equipped group of adventurers. How droll!"]]>

    <string id="46">
        <![CDATA["Well, I imagine you've just come to kill me and take my horde, or something tedious and futile like that. If that is the case, you might as well just attack me and get this over with."]]>

    <string id="47">
        <![CDATA[It thinks "Of course, you might be here for some other purpose. Sometimes humans, far in the past, before the dark days of the Empire, came to me for my wisdom. Have you come to see me for any other reason?"]]>

        <![CDATA[The drake might know what happened to the papers you're looking for. Of course, this could also be a trap. Do you talk to it and say what you're after?]]>

    <string id="50">
        <![CDATA[You describe to the drake the papers you're looking for. It thinks. "Old Empire records. Come to think of it, yes, I do have something like that." It leaves the cavern for a moment, and then returns.]]>

    <string id="51">
        <![CDATA["Yes! The ogres once thought that they could appease me with something besides sacrifices, and threw down to me everything they could get their hands on, including a bunch of old records."]]>

        <![CDATA["Normally, I would charge you a stiff price for these papers, like a human sacrifice or some such, but I have the nagging feeling the Empire really doesn't want you to have these."]]>

    <string id="53">
        <![CDATA["The Empire has killed almost all of my kind. Anything that annoys them, I will help with. Therefore, I will give you these papers for only 500 gold, or however much gold you have if you don't have that."]]>

    <string id="54">
        <![CDATA[It snorts a powerful cloud of frost from its enormous nostrils. "Do you agree?"]]>

    <string id="56">
        <![CDATA[It nods, satisfied (and perhaps slightly relieved at avoiding a combat with you). You pay it your gold, and it leaves the cavern to retrieve the Empire papers. It gives the thick bundle to you.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="57">
        <![CDATA[It chuckles again, and says "Good luck with your efforts. The only thing I enjoy more than the taste of your kind's flesh is the thought of your leader's misfortune."]]>

    <string id="58">
        <![CDATA[With that benediction, it shows to you a rear exit at the far end of its lair, and slams a portcullis closed behind you with an enormous, clawed foot. It turns and walks away, leaving you with your prize, and the exit before you!]]>

    <string id="62">
        <![CDATA[Searching greedily through the drake's treasure trove, you notice a thick sheaf of papers tossed carelessly off in the corner. You look them over and realize that they're a packet of Empire troop orders and patrol rosters!]]>
