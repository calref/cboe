    <string id="1">
        <![CDATA[He decided not to. You woke up in this cell, beaten and bruised. Several days have passed. The time was spent recuperating, eating the wormy (but edible) food they brought you, and listening to their taunts.]]>

        <![CDATA[Instead, it lands in front of Luna. The explosion flings her against the far wall like a rag doll, shattering her ribcage. She wasn't the only foe to be killed by the bomb, either. Not a great advantage, but it's a start.]]>
