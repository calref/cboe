        <![CDATA[The air is dry, and a constant, low hum fills the air. The floor is still impeccably clean and polished, and no mold or sign of decay has successfully intruded on this place. Light is no problem. The walls themselves glow with the energy of the place.]]>

        <![CDATA[This room is filled with strange walls. Or panels. Or devices. You aren't sure. They're metal, and glow slightly, and emit a constant, soothing hum. Some have flashing lights on them, some buttons. None of them have a clear purpose.]]>
