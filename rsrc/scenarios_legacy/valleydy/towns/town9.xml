        <![CDATA[The south exit from the room is blocked by a massive black wall, magically shaped from the living rock of the caverns. As if a five foot thick sheet of solid rock wasn't enough, it's also covered with a multitude of protective runes. This is a problem.]]>

        <![CDATA[The destruction of this level miraculously left this small shrine somewhat intact. In particular, the altar managed to survive, its aura of holiness protecting it from the evil and horror all around you.]]>

        <![CDATA[Considering the amount of time it's been closed up, the good condition of the School has been quite a surprise. The rooms, furniture, and (unfortunately) denizens have been amazingly intact.]]>

        <![CDATA[At first, it seems that you've found areas that have been struck by the inevitable decay. This floor is in an advanced state of disrepair. The walls have collapsed, the ceiling has caved in in places, and rubble and debris are everywhere.]]>
    </string>
    <string id="14">
        <![CDATA[Looking closer, however, you realize that the decay was not natural. The walls and rubble have been scorched by fire, and the structures look less like they've fallen apart and more like they were torn apart.]]>

        <![CDATA[You find a spellbook which managed to escape the destruction of this floor. It's tricky, but you manage to decode it. You can now cast the spell Venom Arrows.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you get closer, however, you notice that something isn't right about the voices. They're not gruff and guttural, like goblin voices. They're high pitched, chirpy, and friendly, like ... like ...]]>

        <![CDATA[You see them ahead, skittering about on the arachnid legs, making webs, chatting happily, and keeping busy. Some monsters are more dangerous. But few are more irritating ...]]>

        <![CDATA[You leave the spiders' caves and enter a new area. Instead of spiders bothering you, you are now surrounded by flying gnats. Like the spiders, these gnats are much larger than usual. In fact, each is about the size of your hand.]]>

    <string id="35">
        <![CDATA[Interesting ... you wouldn't have thought that gnats would act like pack rats. Mindless as they may be, they've happily gathered all manner of junk in this room. You see broken scroll tubes, scraps of paper, pottery, and all manner of junk.]]>

    <string id="36">
        <![CDATA[There might even be something useful buried in there. Alas, you don't have the months it would take to sort through it all.]]>

    <string id="37">
        <![CDATA[You're in luck! If the spiders hadn't told you about it, you wouldn't have even known to look. You find a small, round black stone, carefully polished, not unlike the stone you used to get inside the School.]]>

    <string id="45">
        <![CDATA[The second interesting thing is the nature of the water. It has the same oily sheen and bitter, acrid smell as the water on the surface. For some reason, the curse is present inside the school too.]]>

        <![CDATA["Yeah, we can help you! Thanks for the happy eggs, by the way. Don't forget ... a gnat took the stone. It was small and shiny and black, and it's sure to be hidden in the gnat caves somewhere or other."]]>
