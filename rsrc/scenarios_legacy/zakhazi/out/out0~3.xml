        <![CDATA[You get a sinking feeling as you look north. There was a path alongside the river up until very recently. Then it was destroyed, probably by a cave quake. You can't go any farther north on foot.]]>

        <![CDATA[At first, you though it was a natural basalt spire, perched on the shore of this subterranean river. As you got closer, however, you came to realize that it was man-made.]]>

        <![CDATA[It's a black, windowless tower, about fifty feet high, jutting out slightly into the river. The stone is dark, cracked, and mottled by mold and lichen. It's a dark, quiet building, and it doesn't look like anyone has visited it for some time.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you row your barge into this underground lake, darkness envelops you. Snaky tentacles of shadow slide up the sides of your craft and envelop you. It's as if the darkness is a palpable living thing, so persistent is its advance.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you stare down into this massive chasm, you notice that a crude stairway has been hewn into its side, spiraling down far beyond the range of your lights into the darkness.]]>

        <![CDATA[You toss a pebble over the side and count seconds until you hear it hit the bottom. The sound never comes. This might be a long stairway.]]>

    <string id="16">
        <![CDATA[You climb down, hoping to find a shortcut to Fort Cavalier or, failing that, an interesting encounter. Instead, you just keep climbing. The stairway continues downward, not ending and never coming in sight of the end.]]>

        <![CDATA[As you walk down the path, you meet travelers coming the other way. They look tired and bedraggled by their journey. However, they aren't human.]]>

        <![CDATA[They're humanoids, but their heads and hands are feline. Their fur is matted and scruffy, and they look very hungry. They quickly decide that you would make a good meal for them.]]>
