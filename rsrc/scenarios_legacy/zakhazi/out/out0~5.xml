        <![CDATA[The entrance to this narrow valley is marked by a long row of very grisly trophies. They're dead humans. Some wear the uniforms of the Exile armor. Some are dressed like travelers. All have been hanging here for some time.]]>

        <![CDATA[Hawthorne was a foe of Exile before he was assassinated. That would mean that some of these totems were made decades ago. However, some of them are clearly much newer than that. Very odd.]]>

        <![CDATA[The path to the south is steep. Very steep. It slopes downward at a 45 degree angle, and then grows even steeper. Sliding down it would be no problem. However, without climbing equipment, which you lack, getting back up would be a problem.]]>

        <![CDATA[You are at the south end of a steep path up to the top of a plateau. Whoever was at the top of the plateau would have a panoramic view of the whole cavern to the south. Of course, why anyone would walk to look at that mess is beyond you.]]>

        <![CDATA[You look up, and see several red creatures floating about you. You look around, and see another boulder farther down, which reads "Leave money." It would appear that, if you left some gold, they would leave you alone. Maybe.]]>
