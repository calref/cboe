Classic Blades of Exile
=======================

This project hosts the source code to the classic RPG creator Blades of Exile after it was released
by Spiderweb Software under GPLv2. It is a svn-git transfer from the
[Google Code Progect](http://code.google.com/p/openexile/); all issues and trunk code has been ported.

The primary purpose of this project is to provide bug fixes to Blades of Exile
so that it can compile and run on modern operating systems. The secondary purpose is
to generalize and extend its functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility.

If you would like to be added to this project contact [Sylae](https://github.com/sylae)
or one of the other people on the owners list. This is an open project, with no strong prerequisites
for getting commit access. With that in mind, please be careful of what you check into the repository.
Please do not commit any binaries, junk files, or anything that doesn't compile.

The current task at hand is to merge the Mac and Windows code into the unified wxWidgets code base.

Linux
-----

At last, there is a potential Linux version available in the downloads (though so far only the
Character Editor is available). This should be treated as an alpha/beta release, so use with caution.
