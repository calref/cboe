About this copy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is Blades of Exile, a huge, highly-detailed Shareware fantasy role-playing
 system for the Macintosh.
 This remarkable set of programs contains nearly infinite possibilities
 for adventure.
 First, the game itself comes with three full, exciting scenarios, filled
 with excitement, puzzles, and role-playing.
 Then there is the Blades of Exile scenario editor, which you can use to
 make your own role-playing adventures to play yourself or trade with friends.
 Finally, you can obtain scenarios which other people have made with the
 scenario editor and play through them yourself.
 Even when you've finished the scenarios that come with Blades, you've only
 started to tap the potential for fun this product offers you!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2007, ten years after the original release of BoE, the source code of
 the game was released, and the tedious process of updating the game to
 modern standards began.

\begin_layout Section
Playing Tips for Beginners
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blades of Exile (Blades for short) is a computer fantasy role-playing game.
 If you've never played a game of this sort before, much of what's going
 on will be very unfamiliar to you.
 This section provides an overview of how to do the most important things,
 so you don't get too swamped with the details.
 Don't worry - even though Blades of Exile is a complicated program, once
 you can get around, you will be able to pick up other things very easily.
 Also, don't worry if you've never played Exile I-III.
 Experience with those games is not necessary to enjoy Blades of Exile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Starting the game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Blades of Exile, you will control a group (or "party") of up to six adventure
rs (often referred to as PCs, for "player characters").
 You will take these six people on adventures, kill monsters, collect loot,
 and try to save the world.
 Each person has his or her own skills, abilities, and items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start the game, you need to get a group of adventurers.
 From the starting screen, press Create New Party, and watch the introduction.
 When you hit the button, you will be at the party creation screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice you have already been given six characters.
 You can now, if you wish, drop, recreate, or edit these PCs.
 For now, don't worry about this.
 Just hit "Done," and save your party when given the chance.
 You will now see your party displayed on the introduction screen.
 Once you have your adventurers, you need to send them into an adventure
 (called a scenario).
 Click on Start Scenario and select "Valley of Dying Things".
 You're now on an adventure!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What's going on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start in Fort Talrus, an outpost at the entrance to Skylark Vale.
 Skylark Vale is currently afflicted by a horrible plague, a plague only
 you can cure.
 Before you can save the world, however, you need to be able to walk around.
 Many monsters and puzzles will inhibit your progress.
 For now, however, it is enough of a problem just to get equipped and figure
 out how to move around in this odd new world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moving around and getting stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've started the game, you will be in your room in Fort Talrus.
 You can see yourself in bed in the window in the upper left corner of the
 screen (the terrain screen).
 You can move around by pressing the buttons on the keypad, or by moving
 the mouse cursor into the terrain screen and pressing the mouse button.
 Move around a bit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your characters will start with weapons and armor already equipped (i.e.
 worn).
 However, there are more things to be gotten.
 For example, you'll want the lamp on the table.
 Click on the button with the hand on it in the lower left corner (or type
 'g', for Get).
 The getting things window will come up.
 Click on the lamp, and your first character will have it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should now see the lamp in the item window at the right side of the
 screen.
 To the right of it will be four buttons: 'U' (for Use), 'G' (for Give),
 'D' (for Drop), and 'I' (for Item Info).
 When you click on the 'U' button, you'll use the lamp and light will appear.
 Don't do this yet - wait until you're in a dark place, like a dungeon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now move next to one of the dressers.
 Click on the 'D' button by the lamp to drop it.
 You'll need to click where to drop the item.
 Click on the dresser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's gone! You just put the lamp in the dresser.
 Maybe, in addition to the lamp, there's something else in the dresser.
 You should search it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To search something, look at it while standing next to it.
 Stand right under the dresser.
 Press the Eye button (or type 'l'), and click on the dresser (or press
 the '8' on the keypad, for 'up').
 You search the dresser, and will see a list of everything inside.
 Get everything, then search the other dresser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many things, such as barrels, crates, dressers and chests can be searched
 for interesting things.
 If you think something useful is hidden somewhere, be sure to search.
 Any sort of terrain can have something hidden in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you need to get supplies.
 Walk into the door to open it, and enter the room across the hallway.
 There's plenty of items for you there.
 Get them all (again using the get button or typing 'g').
 Don't forget to also take the armor out of the chest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Readying armor and weapons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you have some armor and weapons, it's time to put on your new gear.
 The PC screen, listing your party, is to the upper right.
 One of your characters' names will be in italics.
 This is the active character.
 This character's inventory is given in the item screen below it.
 Click on another PC's name.
 It will become the active character, and that PC's inventory will appear
 below.
 You can also type the PC's number to make them active, a very useful
 shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to one of your PCs inventory pages.
 Click on the name of, say, a suit of armor.
 The name of that item will now appear in italics.
 That means you're wearing it! Click it again to take it off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose one PC has two suits of armor, and you want another PC to be protected.
 Go to the page of the PC with two suits of armor, and hit the 'G' button
 by one of them.
 This gives the item away.
 A window will come up asking who to give the item to.
 Click the button by the name of the PC to give the item to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shift your new stuff around so that your fighters have the best armor and
 weapons.
 There! You're equipped.
 Now, you can start meeting the people in the fort around you, or go out
 and kill something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Talking to people
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get anywhere in Blades of Exile, you'll need to talk to many, many people.
 Might as well try this now.
 Hit 't' and then click on a person to talk to them.
 The talking window will appear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice the buttons at the bottom of this area.
 Click on Name and Job, and you'll get the basic information that character
 has to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ask someone about something, click on the word after they say it.
 If someone says "I really hate goblins," click on goblins to ask about
 it.
 If the person has something to say, the word will flash, and something
 else will come up.
 To see what the person said previously, click on Go Back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talk to people in the fort.
 You'll notice that the guards don't talk to you, but most everything else
 has something to say.
 Be especially sure to go to the southwest corner of Fort Talrus and see
 Commander Terrance, who will tell you a lot of information about your mission.
 Also be sure find a person named Avizo.
 He won't tell you anything useful now, but you'll need to speak with him
 later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, talking to people is how you will buy food and equipment.
 To see if someone has something to sell, press the Buy button.
 If they do, click on the item name to buy it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Killing Stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it's time to go out and fight.
 Might as well get used to combat - you're going to be doing a lot of it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can find stuff to kill by either finding a dungeon or wandering around
 outdoors.
 When you get attacked, to strike back, simply move into the hostile monster.
 You'll swing whatever weapon you have in your hand.
 The text area in the lower right will tell you how your attack went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you kill stuff, the dead monsters will often leave behind more items
 for you to get.
 Unfortunately, you won't always know what these items are, and you won't
 be allowed to sell them until you do.
 There are, fortunately, people in towns who (for a fee) will tell you what
 they are.
 One such person is Axel, in Sweetgrove.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Casting Spells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other necessary skill for playing Blades of Exile is casting spells:
 magical incantations which do all sorts of stuff.
 There are two sorts of spells: mage spells, which tend to do damage and
 help in combat, and priest spells, which tend to heal and help the party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to cast a spell is to use the Mage Spells or Priest spells
 menus.
 To have a PC cast a spell, click on their name to make the PC active.
 The Mage Spells (or Priest Spells) menu will list all available spells.
 Select the spell to cast it.
 If it's a spell cast on another character, like Minor Heal, you'll be asked
 whom to cast it on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also cast spells by using the Mage and Priest Spell windows, which
 you bring up by clicking on the spell casting buttons in the lower left,
 or by typing 'm' or 'p'.
 Instructions for using these windows are given in the spell casting chapter.
 They're a little more complicated to use, but have the advantage of being
 usable entirely from the keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are seven levels of spells, each more draining and powerful than the
 spells in the level before.
 You start with characters able to cast all spells from levels 1 to 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Secret Doors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some doors (in all sorts of walls and in cave walls as well) are hidden.
 To search the walls, walk into them.
 If there is a secret door there, you'll pass through the wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to the north side of the building you started in and walk along the wall
 to the west (stand right next to the wall and don't go north, or you'll
 leave town).
 When you reach the mountains to the northwest of the building, walk west
 through them.
 You'll find an interesting (and hostile) surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
If you get stuck
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, it's possible that you will still get stuck.
 Maybe you always get killed, or you can't find any money, or something
 else.
 Should this happen, Blades of Exile comes with a character editor, which
 can heal your characters and give them as much gold and food as they want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moving onward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, when you're through with Fort Talrus, walk out of the building
 you started in, and walk north.
 You'll eventually leave the town you're in and be outdoors.
 You'll be standing by a road.
 Follow it north, and you will eventually find a town called Sweetgrove.
 Walk into it to enter it.
 You're on your way!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is only a brief overview, of course.
 It says nothing about training, or many important things about spellcasting.
 It will, however, get you moving, and once you're getting around, you should
 find the rest falls into place very quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So welcome to the wild world of Blades of Exile! And good luck! Who knows?
 You may actually be able to make a difference!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction to the World of Exile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world of Exile is a huge place.
 Actually, it's two very different worlds in one.
 First, there's the surface world.
 The surface world is ruled by the Empire.
 That's what its called.
 The Empire.
 Not the Empire of Something, or the Something Empire.
 Just the Empire.
 It's understandable.
 There's no need for elaborate names when there's only one game in town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second world is the underworld, the networks of thousands of miles of
 caverns and tunnels, ever hidden from the sun, spiraling down to depths
 unimagined, filled with bizarre races of creatures, some friendly, most
 hostile.
 For many years, the Empire, in its arrogance, banished everyone it felt
 didn't fit in.
 Eccentrics, petty criminals, malcontents, they were all regarded as undesirable
 by the Empire.
 And, for many years, these unwanted citizens were sent into this underworld.
 There, against horrible odds, they formed their own nation.
 They called it Exile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exile is a network of hundreds of miles of caves and tunnels, forming an
 enormous, weblike labyrinth of warrens under the surface of the world.
 Kept lit by magic, fed by fungus, and populated by the unending stream
 of humans (and humanoids) from the surface, the people of Exile struggled
 by as best they could for many years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were opposed by demons.
 Many of these creatures, led by the demon lord Grah-Hoth, had been Exiled
 from the infernal realms to the caves where the humans were sent.
 There were the Nephilim, a barbarian race that once roamed the surface
 and, like the Exiles, had been banished from the surface.
 There were the slithzerikai, a subterranean lizard people, many of whom
 considered humans to be foes at best, meat at worst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed that there was no way for the humans to survive in this alien
 environment, opposed as they were by so many hostile creatures.
 When Exile was established, however, the Empire, complacent and arrogant,
 made its greatest mistake and gave Exile the boon it needed to survive.
 It sent down several mages, powerful mages, who were on the wrong side
 of a political struggle.
 The winners, Emperor Hawthorne and the archmage Garzahd, were confidant
 that sending down these archmagi would not be a problem.
 They even thought that maybe their skills could later be harnessed, once
 they were beaten down by several years of rotting in the sunless lands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They could not have been more wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the exiled wizards, like Rone, and Solberg, and Patrick, were content
 simply building a better life for the Exiles.
 They united the Exiles into one nation, raised an army, and beat back the
 Nephilim and slithzerikai and, in one huge battle, imprisoned the demon
 Grah-Hoth.
 From there, the wizards tried to form a healthy, peaceful life, doing their
 best to forget the humans who had sent them from the light of the sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the wizards, however, was named Erika Redmark.
 A harsh and vindictive incantatrix, she enlisted a band of adventurers,
 made tough by their years below, in a wild, dangerous, and eventually successfu
l scheme.
 She wanted to assassinate Hawthorne, brilliant and evil Emperor of the
 surface world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five years later, Hawthorne was killed in his own throne room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The response was immediate, and vicious.
 First, the portal into Exile was closed.
 Nobody was to be sent through.
 Second, other portals were created in remote areas of Exile.
 Soldiers were sent there, the finest soldiers in the Empire's army.
 They had one mission: Vengeance.
 Not one citizen in this subterranean den of vipers was to escape alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In launching this invasion, however, the Empire made their critical mistake.
 They discovered a new, bizarre, humanoid race living even farther down
 in the caves - the Vahnatai.
 These creatures were highly intelligent and resourceful, and very skilled
 in the use of crystals for magical deeds.
 In fact, they had the ability to take the spirits of their ancestors, and
 bring them back in crystalline form.
 These revered forefathers, the Crystal Souls, were their spiritual guides,
 and the beings most revered by their people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Empire, seeing how strange and powerful the Crystal Souls were, kidnapped
 three of them.
 The Vahnatai, appalled by the magnitude of this crime but unsure of the
 identity of the perpetrators, attacked Exile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, aided by the peaceful Vahnatai Bon-Ihrno, a group of bold Exiles
 were able to infiltrate the Empire lands, steal the Crystal Souls, and
 return them to their rightful owners.
 In return, the Vahnatai joined forces with the Exiles, and used their mighty
 magic to slaughter the Empire troops.
 The Empire War finally ended, bloodily and victoriously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aided by Erika Redmark and their new Vahnatai allies, the Exiles built a
 mighty teleporter, a magical machine able to send many people in an instant
 from the caves to the surface.
 The Exiles hoped to find a part of the world as yet uncrushed by the Empire.
 Little did they know that the Vahnatai had plotted a savage revenge against
 the Empire.
 Their fury at the Empire for stealing their Crystal Souls was so great
 that they tried to kill every person on the surface, by inflicting them
 with plagues of vicious, lethal magical monsters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, a band of Exiles, seeing the surface world they so longed to
 rejoin threatened, opposed the Vahnatai and brought the plagues of monsters
 to an end.
 The leader of the Vahnatai, Rentar-Ihrno, was defeated.
 She fled to the lowest depths of the underworld, but not before she slew
 Erika.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empress Prazak, the leader of the Empire, who is a good deal wiser and kinder
 than her predecessor, rewarded the Exiles with a corner of Valorim, the
 wildest and most unsettled portion of the Empire.
 Half of the people of Exile left the caves they loathed to return home.
 They now live on the surface, and have an uneasy peace with the Empire.
 The rest of the Exiles stay below, having come to regard Exile as their
 home.
 They have been joined by many friendly slithzerikai and Nephilim, although
 the barbarian members of those races raid Exile settlements whenever possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, below everyone, ever lurk the Vahnatai.
 The Vahnatai still nurse a constant fury against the humans that defied
 them, and they are nervous about the other races that are constantly advancing
 through the caves they consider theirs.
 On the other hand, many of them, in their hearts, long for peace.
 It is a constant political struggle in the Vahnatai homeland, and the few
 contacts between them and other races tend to be very eccentric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many forces in these two worlds, above and below ground.
 The people of Exile, above and below the surface, try to survive.
 The Empire tries to hold control, even as forces of rebellion keep poking
 up all around.
 The Vahnatai want to be safe.
 The Nephilim and slithzerikai fight to survive, often at the expense of
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a tumultuous world, filled with combat and confusion.
 What better environment for a group of adventurers (like you) to make their
 fortunes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Blades of Exile Menu

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is going on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you can do anything, you will need to create a band of adventurers
 for yourself to control.
 This group of adventurers, called a party, will be your agents in the strange
 worlds you find yourself in.
 You can control them, talk to people through them, and sometimes even get
 them killed.
 You have to have a party before you can start an adventure.
 To make a party, select Make New Party on the title screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Creating a party
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A party is the group of up to 6 adventurers, called player characters (PCs
 for short).
 You can play a party of your own making, or get a prefabricated party provided
 by the game.
 When you first run the game, select 'Make New Party' from the opening screen.
 You can then choose whether to play a prefab party or make one from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you hit Make New Party, you will be given the introduction to the game.
 Click the mouse button when you're through watching it.
 Then you will see the Party Creation window.
 You will be given six prefabricated characters, each with preassigned skills
 and abilities.
 To get rid of a prefab PC, hit the Delete button by its name, and then
 hit the Create button.
 When your party is how you want it, press the Done button to start the
 game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the party creation window, you can select each of your character's
 names, graphics, race, advantages/disadvantages, and skills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Race, PC Traits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of your characters can be one of three different races, and have any
 of several advantages or disadvantages.
 These traits will help or hinder your character in various ways.
 They will also affect how quickly your character gains strength.
 If you take a character with lots of advantages, he or she will gain skills
 at a much lower rate.
 If there are lots of disadvantages, the character will gain skills faster.
 These are the races and character traits.
 Details on each race and trait are visible in the appendices.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 else to open it.
\end_layout

 sufficient alchemy skill, select Do Alchemy from the Actions menu.
 You will be asked who is going to make it, and then given a list of potions
 you can make.

 game select Alchemy Info, under the Library menu.
\end_layout

 When you hit the Sell button while talking, smaller Sell buttons appear
 by your items.
 Some people only buy armor, some only weapons, some everything.
 Click the small Sell button to sell an item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People will only buy identified items.
 To identify an item, go to a sage (such as Axel, in Sweetgrove, in "Valley
 of Dying Things").
 Ask about 'identify' (or, usually, click the Buy button), and ID buttons
 will appear by your unidentified items.
 Click this button to pay to have it identified.
 You will now know exactly what it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a very few people will cast magical spells to strengthen your identifie
d, non-magical weapons.
 When this is offered, small 'Augm' buttons will appear by items that can
 be augmented.
 Press them to buy the improvement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Record
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has your characters write down what was just said.
 You can review it later by selecting See Talking Notes from the Options
 menu.

\begin_layout Standard
Ends the conversation.

Why Talking is a Good Thing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Special Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Occasionally, someone will tell you something that will help you do something
 else, such as a password or the location of a hidden item.
 When this happens, you will be told something along the lines of "You take
 note of this." This means your characters know something new.
 If you die later without saving, be sure to go back to get this information
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Stores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the towns have a store of some sort in them.
 To buy something or sell something, you can generally press the appropriate
 buttons.
 How to buy, sell, and identify items is described later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can spend your experience to gain valuable skills at the occasional
 training center.
 This works exactly the same as when you created your character, but you
 also have to pay gold.
 Each level in a skill costs the amount after the slash in the cost column.
 Should you buy some skills and then decide you don't want them, press the
 Cancel button to restore your character.
 Press the Keep button to keep the training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Boats and horses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people will sell you boats and horses, both useful ways to get around.
 When you buy one, a nearby boat or horse will become yours, and you will
 be able to enter/mount it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting Spaces Shortcut
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you hit the 'look' button (or the 'talk' button), click on the space
 you want to look at to look at (talk to) it.
 A quicker way to look at something is to hit 'l' on the keyboard, and then
 the keypad key in the direction you want to look.
 This has you look at (or talk to) whatever is in the next space in that
 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting Around The Outdoors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you leave town, you will be in the massive caverns that make up Exile
 or the Empire, or the seemingly limitless expanses of the surface.
 The things you can do out here are similar to what you can do indoors,
 but slightly more restricted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving around and casting spells works the same as in town.
 However, the spells you can cast are a bit more limited.
 Looking works the same, although there will no longer be things to search
 (there are still signs to read).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map button works the same.
 You will keep track of what you've seen outside, and can call it back up.
 However, if you move a long way away from an area and then return, you
 may have forgotten what you saw the first time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you see a town, tower, fort or dungeon, move onto it to enter it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in town, you can find boats and horses to get around on.
 Move onto a boat to board it, and steer the boat onto ground to disembark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Watch out for waterfalls! Not only will they suck you down them, but when
 you fall down one you lose a bunch of food too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will still be combats outdoors.
 Occasionally, monsters will run up to attack you.
 When this happens, you will find yourself on a battlefield where you will
 fight the monsters, much as you would have fought them in town.
 Finally, certain outdoor combats are automatic.
 These special combats will happen even when you aren't adjacent to the
 monsters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can drop items outdoors, but when you do, they're gone forever.
 Should a PC die (of starvation, for example), the PC's items will appear
 on the ground the next time you enter a town or get in an outdoor combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three new buttons outdoors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Rest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A tent, r) When you are far from a friendly town and a hospitable inn,
 this is your best option for recovering strength.
 When you press this button, you will settle down for a while and sleep.
 You will wake up, however, if a group of monsters gets close to you, and
 not get any rest in the bargain.
 It is usually best to rest in secluded areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You cannot rest if someone is poisoned, if you are on dangerous ground (such
 as swamp or lava), or if you don't have enough food to get through the
 night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Save and Restore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Disk with arrow pointing to it/out) These magical buttons enable you to
 make a 'snapshot' of the current status of your game so that, should you
 get killed, misplace the game-winning artifact, etc., you can return to
 the spot you saved at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you click on save, you can enter a name for the snapshot of your progress.
 When you restore, double click on the file you saved.
 You can also save from the pull-down File menu.
 You can also save in town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Killing Stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combat works much like being in town or outdoors, except that you move your
 party one PC at a time instead of all at once.
 You will get to move each of your PCs, and then all the other people/monsters
 move (and maybe attack you).
 Then the process repeats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difference between normal town and combat mode, of course, is that
 you're probably trying to kill something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Action Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each turn, each character get a base 4 action points.
 Wearing heavy armor reduces this amount; being hasted increases it.
 Whenever you do something, this amount goes down.
 It can go negative, and when your PC has 0 or less action points, your
 turn ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actions you can perform in combat are listed below, with their action
 point cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Line of Sight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A character can only fire a missile or spell at a location he or she can
 see.
 Also, trees and other obstructions between the shooter and the target will
 make the missile less effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When targeting, a line will appear between the attacker and the target.
 When the line disappears, you can't see the space you're aiming at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moving and Attacking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You move by clicking on the terrain screen in the desired direction.
 To attack something, move into that thing.
 The result of your attack will appear to the lower right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you attack someone who wasn't attacking you, you will be asked if you
 really want to do that.
 Attacking innocents will bring the town guard down on your head, and you
 may have a serious problem.
 Be careful! Merely causing damage to an innocent will also bring the cops
 down on your head, and you may not get a warning before you do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Switching Places
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In combat, when one PC moves into another, they switch places.
 This is very useful during combat in cramped quarters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stand Ready
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, when you click on the active character, that character will wait.
 However, should a hostile creature then move into weapon range, that PC
 will attack the enemy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Targeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you cast a magic spell or fire a missile, you select a creature to
 fire at by clicking on it.
 When you may want to aim at someone off screen, before selecting your target
 you can scroll the view around by clicking on the border of the terrain
 screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Look
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Eye, 'l', 0 AP) Looking works much as it did before, with one major difference:
 when you start looking, you can click on the border of the terrain screen
 to move the view around, and see things that were off-screen before.
 Note, however, you cannot see things by scrolling the screen around that
 you haven't yet seen by being close to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Shield, 'd', all AP) Should a character be at risk, you can have that character
 use his or her turn simply defending.
 How effective this is depends heavily on the defense skill of the character,
 although there will always be some benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Hand grabbing scroll, 'g', 4 AP) Works exactly as before, except you don't
 get to choose who gets the item - the active character gets it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hitting 'G' has your party grab all nearby items.
 This only works when no monsters are visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wait
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
('Wait', 'w', 0 AP) Clicking this has the PC wait for the other PCs to attack.
 Eventually, he or she will get another chance to act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shoot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Arrow, 's', bow - 3 AP, thrown missile - 2 AP) When you click on this and
 the active PC has a thrown missile weapon or a bow and arrows equipped,
 you will shoot a missile at the target you select.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
End Combat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
('End', 'e') In town, when you are through fighting, click this button to
 go back into town mode (whether or not any foes remain).
 When in an encounter outdoors, you can resume traveling by clicking this
 button (although it will only work if all the enemies are dead).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Active
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
('Act', 'x') Clicking on this button makes the current PC the only active
 PC.
 None of the other PCs will do anything until the active PC dies, or you
 click the 'Act' button again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other actions have an action point cost:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using An Item (3 AP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equipping/Removing An Item (1 AP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Giving An Item (1 AP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dropping An Item (1 AP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Moving a Space (1 AP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting Damaged, Armor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time you get hit, your health goes down.
 When you receive a blow that would take you to 0 or less health, you end
 up at 0 health (this is signified by a coughing noise).
 When you get damaged and have 0 health, you die.
 When you take a lot of damage and have 0 health, you will be obliterated
 (making this PC much harder to raise from the dead).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, there is a wide variety of armor in the game.
 Armor will not reduce the number of blows you take, but will reduce the
 amount of damage you take when those blows land.
 However, the heavier the armor, the more it interferes with your ability
 to attack and cast spells (although defense skill reduces this effect).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing armor takes a while.
 While you can change helms, gloves boots, and shields in the heat of combat,
 you cannot change armor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dying
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This happens.
 A lot.
 When it does, all the newly deceased's possessions drop to the ground in
 a pile.
 Should this happen when you are in a boat, you may need to row back for
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Items can't be dropped when outdoors.
 Should someone die when wandering around outside, the items will stay with
 you until you enter a town or get into combat, at which point they immediately
 drop to the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dead people can be brought back to life.
 This can be done using certain priest spells, or at the healers you will
 find in some of the towns.
 If the killing blow does enough damage, it will turn the PC into dust.
 It will then be much more difficult to raise them from the dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Killing Enemies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever you kill an enemy, the person dealing the death blow gets some
 experience, and everyone else gets a much smaller amount.
 Should this experience give you a level, the game will let you know in
 the text screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Treasure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will appear when the monster is killed and you get lucky.
 If you have decent Item Lore skill, the item may even appear fully identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fleeing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, sometimes the enemy is just too tough.
 When this happens, it is possible to escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In town combat, you must move your party to the outskirts of town, leave
 combat mode, and then walk out of town.
 You cannot leave town when you're in combat,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In outdoor combat, you flee by moving to the boundary of the battlefield
 (which will look like a black nothingness) and walk off.
 If you succeed, the character will have fled.
 When your whole party is fled or dead, or you've killed all of the enemies
 and pressed the End Combat button, combat will end and your party will
 be reunited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are adjacent to a monster and move away from it, it will get a free
 attack against you.
 The same goes in reverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Poisoning a Weapon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using poison poisons your equipped weapon, which can be either a hand-to-hand
 weapon or a quiver of arrows (not darts or throwing knives).
 Hitting a monster with it then does a considerable amount of damage, spread
 out over time.
 The level of the poison decreases with every blow delivered and every blow
 that lands.
 The poison is lost should you change weapons or leave town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using poison on an already poisoned weapon gives the weapon a strength of
 poison equal to the maximum strength of the poison already there and the
 poison you're putting on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Enemy Resistances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a wide variety of types of damage you can do.
 Hand to hand weapons do physical damage.
 Poison is another kind of damage, fire is another, non-fire magic (such
 as ice bolts or kill spells) is yet another.
 These sorts of damages affect different monsters differently.
 Many monsters are resistant to fire.
 Less are resistant to magic.
 Very few are resistant to poison, however - keep this in mind when dealing
 with that pesky enemy mage in the back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Miscellaneous
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Material Wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three sorts of possessions you can come across:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gold: Well, this isn't always literal chunks of gold.
 It's gold nuggets or silver coins or trade goods or anything else you can
 give people to get stuff.
 You start with a small amount, and can get more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Food: Preserved giant lizard steaks, dried mushrooms, yummy, tangy lichens,
 and all the other rich bounty of Exile.
 Every once in a while you will eat some of it, one unit for each active
 PC.
 Not having enough food results in starvation, damage, and bad things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Items: Each PC can carry 24 objects, such as armor, helmets, tools, weapons,
 etc.
 You can do various things with these items.
 These are described in Chapter 4.
 You can only carry so much weight.
 The amount of bulk you can carry depends on your strength.
 Armor is very heavy, while potions and scrolls aren't.
 When equipping items, you only have two hands, and some weapons take up
 both of them.
 You can only wear two rings, and one necklace (too many magic items interfere
 with each other in bizarre ways).
 Beware.
 When you equip a cursed item, you will need to find a healer to take the
 curse off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are seven levels of spells.
 Your characters begin the game knowing most spells up to third level.
 They can cast a mage spell of a given level if they have enough spell points,
 and Mage Spells skill of that level (and the same goes for priest spells).
 Upon casting, the character loses the spell points, and something neat
 happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spell effects are cumulative, and build up quickly.
 For example, if you bless a character twice, the effect will be much more
 than twice the effect of one bless.
 When you poison a monster twice, it will do well over twice the damage
 the first spell would have caused.
 If one fear spell doesn't make a monster flee, the next one will have a
 much better chance of working.
 Casting two light spells makes the light last twice as long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mage spells require great delicacy of movement to cast.
 For this reason, they cannot be cast when when armor with total encumbrance
 of more than 1 is being worn.
 High defense skill can sometimes offset this effect, but it never will
 when any single item has an encumbrance value of more than 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mage Spells and Encumbrance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are wearing armor with a total encumbrance of greater than one, you
 cannot cast mage spells.
 However, high defense skill can counteract this.
 If your armor isn't too bulky, sometimes defense skill will enable you
 to cast spells (though spells never, ever work when any single item has
 an encumbrance value greater than 2).
 If you fail, however, you lose your turn.
 Priest spells, consisting mainly of prayers shouted very loudly, do not
 have this limitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multiple Target Spells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some spells, such as the Arrow spells, have more than one target.
 When you cast such a spell, click on each target.
 Click on a target again to untarget it.
 Should you decide to cast the spell without using all your targets, hit
 space.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dumbfound
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being dumbfounded reduces the number of spells you can cast.
 Being a little dumbfounded prevents you from casting high level spells.
 The more dumbfounded you are, the more spells you lose access to.
 The priest spell Restore Mind, healers, and certain magic items can undo
 the effects of dumbfounding.

\begin_layout Standard
The most (potentially) powerful summoning spells are Capture Soul and Simulacrum.
 Casting Capture Soul on a monster stores a copy of it in your party's mind.
 Later, you can cast Simulacrum to bring a copy of the monster forth.
 Collect copies of the most powerful monsters and bring them to your aid!
 You can only remember at most 4 monsters.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Chronic Disease
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(-20%) This poor character has been cursed with notoriously poor health.
 Illness constantly nips at his or her heels.
 This character will occasionally, spontaneously become diseased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Bad Back
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(-8%) Owning this trait makes the character unable to carry as much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
PC Skills
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The myriad skills you can buy for your characters are described below.
 Each can attain a maximum level of 20, unless otherwise specified.
 The cost for each skill in Skill Points is in parentheses after its name.
 Note that, when training in these skills later, each point of increase
 will cost gold, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Big Three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The below three skills are very important.
 When high, they give many bonuses in the things you do.
 On the other hand, when one of these three skills is below 4, the PC will
 have penalties in any situation involving that skills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Strength
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Measures how much brute strength the character possesses.
 High strength increases damage done in combat, improves odds of kicking
 down doors, and has other, more subtle effects.
 IMPORTANT - Strength also affects how much health you gain when you attain
 a level, and how many items you can carry.
 Buy strength up to 3 as soon as possible.
 Otherwise, you won't gain much health when you gain levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Dexterity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Measures how nimble the character is.
 High dexterity gives a better chance of hitting in combat (especially with
 missile weapons) and makes the character harder to hit.
 High dexterity also makes picking locks and disarming traps easier.
 A PC in combat with a 1 dexterity will miss a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Intelligence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) Measures mental strength and dexterity.
 High intelligence also makes your spells more effective, sometimes very
 much so.
 Intelligence below 4 makes your spells work poorly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Weapons Skills
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Edged
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The higher the skill, the better the chance to hit with daggers, swords,
 axes, and other bladed weapons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Bashing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The higher the skill, the better the chance to hit with clubs, maces,
 flails, hammers, and other blunt weapons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Pole
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The higher the skill, the better the chance to hit with spears, halberds,
 bardiches, slith spears, and other pole weapons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thrown Missile (1) The higher the skill, the better the chance to hit darts,
 thrown daggers, and most other missile weapons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Bow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The higher the skill, the better the chance to hit with bows and crossbows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Defense
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) This skill has three effects.
 It determines how well a character does at parrying, decreases the penalty
 in combat from bulky armor, and occasionally decreases the damage taken
 from enemies' weapons.
 Bulky armor prevents a character from casting mage spells.
 However, when your armor is only a little too bulky, sometimes casting
 a mage spell will sometimes work when the mage has high defense skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Mage Spells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(6) This skill is very expensive and very powerful.
 It enables the owner to cast Mage spells of a level up to the level of
 skill owned.
 The maximum level is 7.
 You automatically know most spells of level 3 and below.
 It takes some time to find spells of level 4 and above.
 Thus, getting these skills above level 4 at the beginning may not be a
 good idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Priest Spells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) This skill is very expensive and very powerful.
 It enables the owner to cast Priest spells of a level up to the level of
 skill owned.
 The maximum level is 7.
 You automatically know most spells of level 3 and below.
 It takes some time to find spells of level 4 and above.
 Thus, getting these skills above level 4 at the beginning may not be a
 good idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Mage Lore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) You will occasionally need to decipher strange magical readings.
 This skill determines how good you are at this.
 If your skill is high enough, you may gain a spell or a valuable piece
 of information.
 What is important when trying to decipher something is how much of this
 skill is present in the party.
 One character with 18 Mage Lore is equivalent to 6 characters with 3 Mage
 Lore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Alchemy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) You will eventually gain the ability to make magic potions.
 To make a given potion, however, your Alchemy skill must be above a certain
 level.
 The higher it is above this level, the better the chance of succeeding.
 When one PC is trying to make a potion, only that PC's Alchemy skill counts.
 Thus, it is much, much better to have one PC with high Alchemy skill than
 several PCs with low Alchemy skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Miscellaneous
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Item Lore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) When you kill a monster, there will occasionally be items on its body.
 Normally, you wouldn't know what they were.
 However, Item Lore skill makes it possible that when you find the item,
 you will know what it is.
 Otherwise, you would have to take it to town and spend money to identify
 it.
 The higher the Item Lore, the better the chance of the item appearing identifie
d.
 In general, several PCs with low Item Lore is better than one PC with high
 Item Lore.
 Item Lore does not affect items already in town when you enter, or items
 gained in special encounters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Traps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Many chests and some corridors will have traps on them, which can be
 devastating.
 You will, however, be given a chance to pick a PC to disarm it.
 Chance of success depends on this skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Pick Locks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Many towns and dungeons will have locked doors.
 A PC with some of this skill and lock picks equipped can try to pick them.
 The higher this skill, the better.
 Beware.
 Some locks are magical, and cannot be picked.
 Try the spell Unlock Doors on these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Assassination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Sometimes, when a character attacks a much weaker monster, the blow
 will do a good deal of extra damage.
 The more of this skill you have, the better the chance of this happening,
 and the stronger the monsters it can affect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Poison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) You will find poisons, which you can put on your weapons for a little
 extra punch.
 Having a few levels in this skill will make it more likely you will put
 the poison on at full strength, and the less likely you will nick yourself
 with the poison accidentally.
 Although you can buy a lot of this skill, 3-4 levels should be sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Luck
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) This skill is expensive, but can be a bargain at twice the cost.
 Its effects are pervasive, subtle, powerful, and sometimes irreplaceable.
