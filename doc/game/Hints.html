<ul>
  <li>Change the game. Select the Preferences option from the File menu, and select Easier Monsters. Your fights from then on will be a lot less stressful. You can also reduce the number of wandering monsters, but this may not be a good idea, as ...</li>
  <li>Wandering monsters are your friends. In Valley of Dying Things, wander around the surface in the northeast corner of valley, killing goblins and bandits. They have good gold, and aren't too tough to fight. Rely heavily on magic at first, until your fighters gain experience.</li>
  <li>There's a lot of encounters and treasures hidden in the outdoors. Remember - to search for secret passages, walk into walls. Walking into mountains around the start will reveal several bits of loot.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to take all the stuff in Fort Talrus (in Valley of Dying Things). There's stuff for you in all of the storerooms. Use the Unlock spell to get into the locked rooms.</li>
  <li>If you get stuck on a puzzle, look in the next chapter. There's a walkthrough for Valley of Dying Things..</li>
