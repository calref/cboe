<h1>The Blades of Exile Editor</h1>
<h2>What is the Blades of Exile Editor?</h2>
<p>This copy of Blades of Exile comes with the Blades of Exile Character Editor, a simple utility for improving your Blades of Exile party in a mind-boggling variety of ways.</p>
<p>The unregistered (i.e. as is) version of the editor can give you unlimited gold and food, heal your party, and do several other useful things (go to the section on menus, and read about the Free Extras menu). The registered version can do much more - give you all sorts of items, complete your quests and give you maps, add as much experience and skill as you want, and more. The registered version comes with Blades of Exile registration.</p>
<h2>Using the Editor</h2>
<h3>How to use the editor</h3>
<p>The Blades of Exile editor is very easy to use. To do so,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run it. It's called Blades Character Editor.</li>
  <li>Select Open from the File menu.</li>
  <li>Select the save file to edit.</li>
  <li>Make the changes.</li>
  <li>Select Save from the File menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make a change, press one of the other buttons. Their uses are described in the next five chapters. Note, however, if you, in an unregistered copy, selecting any option not in the Free Extras menu prevents you from saving that party.</p>
<h3>A Serious Warning</h3>
<p>The Blades of Exile Editor is a powerful utility, and, as has been said, "With great power comes great responsibility." It is not only possible, but in fact quite easy to use the editor to make the game unwinnable. All you need to do is dispose of the wrong item, or rub away the memory of the wrong piece of information. The editor can also correct the damage, of course. But as a rule of thumb, it is best to:
<ol>
  <li>Be careful,</li>
  <li><em>Always</em> keep an unaltered back-up save file, and</li>
  <li>Only do positive things with the editor. It's generally safe to give yourself new information or a new item, but very risky to take things away.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using the Main Screen</h3>
<p>Once you've opened a save file, you'll see your party displayed on the main screen. One character's button will be blue. This is the active character. Click on another character to make him/her active.</p>
<p>To the right is the active character's inventory. To drop an item, click the <span classs="key">D</span> button. To identify an item, click the <span class="key">I</span> button.</p>
<p>To the right are the five buttons you can use to edit this character:</p>
<p><em>Add Mage Spells, Add Priest Spells</em> - Enables you to give or take away the character's ability to cast certain spells. Press the button to the right of a spell to toggle the spell on/off. When the button is lighted green, the party knows the spell.</p>
<p><em>Edit Traits</em> - Enables you to change the character's race, advantages, and disadvantages.</p>
<p><em>Edit Skills</em> - Works like the training window in Blades of Exile, but all training is free. Press the + and - buttons to increment and decrement a skill.</p>
<p><em>Edit XP</em> - Enables you to set the number of experience points the character has. Note that, if you give enough experience for the character to gain a level, the new level won't be awarded right away. The character will get the new level the next time he or she gains experience in Blades of Exile.</p>
<h3>The Blades of Exile Editor Menu</h3>
<p>Most of the Blades of Exile Editor's features are activated through the menus.</p>
<h4>File Menu:</h4>
<p><em>Save</em> - Records the changes you've made. If the editor is unregistered and you've used features not in the Free Extras menu, this won't work.</p>
<p><em>Open</em> - Reads one of your save files in for editing.</p>
<p><em>How To Order</em> - Tells you how to register Blades of Exile.</p>
<p><em>Quit</em> - When you're ready to get back to business.</p>
<h4>Free Extras:</h4>
<p><em>Edit Gold, Edit Food</em> - When selected, you will be allowed to set how much gold or food your party has.</p>
<p><em>Leave Town</em> - Should you become trapped in a town, say by a horde of guards between you and the exit, selecting this option moves your party to the dungeon entrance. Things you did in the dungeon will not be recorded, and your maps will not be saved. Stuff you got will remain yours. Be careful using this option. Suppose, for example, you're in a dungeon you can only enter once, and there's something you need to do inside to win. Use the Leave Town option then, and you won't able to finish the scenario. Back up your save file before using this option.</p>
<p><em>Reunite Party</em> - Sometimes your party gets split up in dungeons. Selecting this option reunites them. As with Leave Town, be careful. This option can deny you the chance to do something you need to do to win the scenario.</p>
<p><em>Make Towns Forget You</em> - Only use this outside town (use Leave Towns first). Any towns that were angry at you will forget about it. Any monsters slain in the dungeons will return to life. This does not affect the people of Shayder's anger if you rob the Anama temple.</p>
<p><em>Heal Damage, Restore Spell Points</em> - These restore your characters to full health and energy.</p>
<p><em>Cure Dead, Stoning, etc.</em> - All Dead, Dust, and Stoned characters will be restored to life.</p>
<p><em>Remove Bad Conditions</em> - All nasty conditions (e.g. disease, dumbfound) will be cured.</p>
<p><em>Remove Party From Scenario</em> - Sometimes you'll be stuck and won't be able to reach the end of a scenario. Sometimes you'll just be sick of it and want out. Use this option. The next time you load this party, you'll be on the Blades of Exile title screen, ready to go on a new adventure.</p>
<h4>Special Edit:</h4>
<p><em>Add Alchemy</em> - This brings up a menu from which you can add and delete knowledge of alchemical recipes. Click on the light by a recipe to add it. Click again to delete it.</p>
<p><em>Own all Boats/Horses</em> - All boats and horses will become your property.</p>
<p><em>Edit Day</em> - This lets you set the current day. Be careful using this - it can have very peculiar effects.</p>
<p><em>Add Outdoor Maps, Add Town Maps</em> - When you select one of these options the Automap in Blades of Exile will display all of the town/outdoor section your party is in. Great for finding hidden stuff!</p>
<h4>Item menus:</h4>
<p>These menus list a wide variety of useful items. Select an item to have it added to the inventory of the active PC.</p>
