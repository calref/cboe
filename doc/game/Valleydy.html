<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Section 13: How to Solve Valley of Dying Things</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This chapter contains all the information you need to get to the end of the scenario Valley of Dying Things.It does not contain the solution to every puzzle. For the minor puzzles and quests, you’ll just have to work them out on your own. What this guide does provide are directions for navigating your way through the main storyline, from the first steps all the way to the grand conclusion.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When you get stuck, go to the section on the appropriate scenario. Each section is divided into subsections, each of which describes a specific part of the scenario. The subsections begin with several questions you might be asking about how to get through. Read these sample questions first. If none of them make any sense, back up to an earlier subsection.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When you find the subsection that describes the area you’re stuck in, start reading. Slowly. Eventually, you get to the area you’re having problems with. If the place you’re stuck at isn’t described, the puzzle you’re working on isn’t important to the overall adventure and can be skipped.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When you’ve found out what you need to know, go back to playing. Try not to read too far ahead ... too many hints can spoil your adventure!</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">What do the coordinates mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of the walkthroughs have coordinates. For example, one hint might be “Now step on the rune at (18,5).” In Blades of Exile, the upper left corner is considered to be (0,0). The spot 5 to the right of that is (5,0). The spot 8 below (0,0) is (0,8). To find out where you currently are, cast the first level priest spell Location. This should help you find your way to the correct space.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Section 1: The Valley of Dying Things</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Getting Into the School</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Sample Questions: How do I start investigating the problem? Where should I look? What’s this school people are talking about? Where do I find Avizo? How do I get into the school?</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>You begin the scenario in Fort Talrus. Leave to the north, and travel up to Sweetgrove. Once inside, talk to Mayor Crouch to find out about the valley’s troubles, and then talk to Axel to find out about the old library (talk to other people for useful background). He mentions you should talk to someone named Avizo. Travel back south to Fort Talrus. Avizo is in the room next to where you started. Ask him about ‘stone’ to get him to talk to you, and then ask about “object” to find out where the Runed Stone is. Go back north to Sweetgrove. Avizo’s store is on the center of town. Break in (use the mage spell Unlock) and search the potted plant at (35,21). Take the stone.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Now it’s time to start investigating the School of Magery. It’s north of Sweetgrove. There’s a large mountain up there with four entrances, north, south, east, and west (to get to the west entrance, walk over the river by the Ford Here sign). Enter at each point, and insert the stone in the hole by the gate. The gates will open, and the school will be open to you.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The School of Magery - Upper Half</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Sample Questions: What do I do in the upper levels of the school? What do I do in the Holding Cells/Storage areas? How do I help the dragon? How do I pass the blocked wall at the south end of the Administration level? How do I pass the glowing gates?</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The stairway down from the School Entry level is in the center. Go down to the Visitor’s Quarters. There are two stairways down on that level, one to the Holding Cells and one to the Storage Areas. One stairway is in the east half of the level. To get there, there is a secret door at (31,2). Go down to the Storage Level first.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There are several places on these levels with closed, glowing gates. Ignore them for now. You’ll get the item to open these much later.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Once on the Storage level, walk south down the central corridor until you reach the sign that reads “HIGH SECURITY CREATURE HOLDING CELL”. Enter this area, and find the dragon Pythras. Talk to her about her imprisonment, and be sure to ask about “magic” or “word.” Go back up to the Visitor’s Quarters and down to the Holding Cells.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The controls to Pythras’ cell are at the east side of the Holding Cells level. Go through the secret door at (46,26), and go to (39,18) to use the control panel. Say “quark” to it, and Pythras will be freed. If you want to explore the northwest corner, you can use the control panel at (41,23).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Pythras escapes the school by going down to the Administrative level. Follow her. Climb down the stairway at (14,42) (in the Holding Cell level - there’s also a stairway down in the Storage Level).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Administration has been wrecked, but you can still make your way through it. There’s a colony of Giant, Intelligent, Friendly Talking Spiders in the southeast corner, but you don’t need to talk to them yet. Instead, you can leave the upper half of the school at the southwest corner of the level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The School of Magery - Lower Half</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Sample Questions: What can I do about the pollution in the cave below the upper half of the school? What do I do at the Major Waste Depository? How do I get into the lower half of the school? How do I reach the stairway down from the Student Quarters? How do I get into the school library? What can I learn from the Vahnatai? How do I exit the Experiment Halls to the south? The people of Marralis want a scepter - where is it?</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When you leave the Administration level, you will find yourself in a huge cavern filled with diseased pollution and filth. This is the source of the Valley’s problem. This huge cavern has several interesting things in it. There is a tunnel up to the surface to the west, which will provide a useful shortcut. To the southeast is the Major Waste Repository. You can explore it a little if you want, but you can’t do anything there yet.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Instead, enter the lower half of the school. The entrance is at the southwest corner of the large cave. You will meet many hostile gremlins. Kill them. These were the student quarters. You will need to find a key to get through. Walk into the west half of the level, go south to (1,46), and search the bookshelf there to get the key.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>There is a scepter hidden at (12,6), which some people on the surface want. It can also cure your disease. You might want to keep it - this is very useful later on.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When you have the key, find your way to the door at (32,37), and go through. You will be in the main dining hall. Go down the stairway on the right, and you will be in the School Library. The library is closed off by another glowing portcullis. You can’t enter it yet. Instead, leave the library at (43,35). You will be in a cavern with several Vahnatai. Talk to them. In particular, talk to Baia-Tel and ask about the “peculiar insect” it said it met. Ask Zereen about “power” or “stone.” Finally, they will tell you that someone on the surface has the instructions to the School controls. This will be important later.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Now that you know that the spiders have something you need, go back up to the Administration level. Talk to different spiders until you meet their chief, and ask it about the “pretty rock.” It will tell you about the giant gnats, and, if you ask, tell you that the password to get to the gnats is “Gnats.” Tell this to the spider at (57,35) and you will be able to reach the gnats.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The eggs you need are at (59,4). Get them and go back to the chief spider. Ask it about “eggs” and it will tell you where the Opening Stone is. Search the trash at (25,3) to get it. You can use this item from the Special Items page. When you do, all glowing portcullises on your current level will open. This will be very useful. Go back down to the Library level.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Open the glowing gate and search the library. The most interesting room is the one in the northeast corner. The room only contains a pedestal, and, when you enter, a ghost tells you that you should place a green book on it.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The green book the spirit refers to is a school textbook. There are three of them in this dungeon. To find one, from the Library level, climb down the stairway at (45,47). You will be on the Experiment Halls level. Go through the door at (36,9) and then the door at (40,11). There will be a green book in this cell. Take it back to the library and place it onto the pedestal in the northeast corner. You will be rewarded with a key. You now are ready to start ending the Valley’s Curse. First, you need to return to the surface. There is a shortcut up in the Experiment Halls level at (44,13).</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Ending the Curse</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Sample Questions:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do I do at Pangle’s Hut? How do I talk to Pangle? How do I get to (and through) the School’s control chambers? What do I do at the Major Waste Depository?</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Once on the surface, you need to get the instructions scroll from Pangle. However, he won’t want to talk to you. Fortunately, Kevin, in Marralis, is a friend of his. Kevin tells you to say his name to Pangle. Go to Pangle, say “Kevin” to him, and question him for a while. Ask about “adventurers” or “interest”, and you will be told about his scroll. Ask about “paper,” and then search the chest at (10,24) to get the instructions to operate the school control. You’re now ready to solve the valley’s problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go back down to the Experiment Halls level.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Leave the level to the south (you’ll use the silver key), and you will be in the caves under the school. Fight your way through them to the southeast corner, where you find a cave. Enter it.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>You will be inside the Control Rooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Use the Opening Stone to get inside. Find your way through to the control chambers on the east side. You will find a shade to talk to, who will tell you a lot of things about the situation with the school. Sit in the throne at (34,20), and the controls to clean up the waste will be activated.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Finally, travel back up to the giant cavern between the Upper and Lower halves of the school and enter the Major Waste Depository. Go through the secret passage at (38,39). Walk up to the gate at (29,2), through the gap at (14,15), and through the gate at (18,24) into the center of the repository. Use the Opening Stone to open the glowing gate, and sit in the chair at (23,23). Sit in the chair, flip the switch, and insert the stone. The cleaning process will begin. Walk out to (26,23), and you will be carried out to safety. You’ve won.</p>
