</div>
<p>You will now be looking at the main Blades of Exile screen. This screen has six distinctive parts.</p>
<h2>Terrain Screen</h2>
<p>When outside or in town, the person in the middle represents your party. Around you will be the flora, fauna, and miscellaneous stuff of the surface or underworld.</p>
<p>To move around, move the cursor into the terrain screen. Move it around. It will turn into an arrow. Click the mouse button when the arrow points in the desired direction. When looking, picking locks, etc. (all described below), to select the item to look at (or whatever) click on it.</p>
<p>The border of the terrain screen is also something to click on. When looking, aiming a missile, or targeting a spell, clicking on the terrain screen border will shift the view of the terrain screen in the appropriate direction.</p>
<h2>Text Bar</h2>
<p>This bar contains information about what's going on. When in combat, it tells you who is active and how many action points they have remaining. Outdoors or in town, it tells you where you are.</p>
<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>These change depending on your setting. What the Outdoor/Town/Combat buttons do is described in the relevant sections.</p>
