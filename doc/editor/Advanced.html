<h1>Section 9: Advanced Topics Introduction</h1>

<p>As fun as making exciting dungeons filled with nasty monsters can be, often the
scenario designers ambitions encompass larger goals. Many designers want to create a plot,
with interesting characters and challenging special encounters. This section describes how
to move on into these challenging and satisfying realms.</p>

<p>Before progressing too far, it is best to read this chapter in its entirety. The basics
here will be necessary to master, if you are to move on.</p>

<h2>Counting and Coordinates</h2>

<p>As described earlier, all counting begins with 0. The first town is town 0, and 2nd
town is town 1, and so on. The coordinate system for Blades of Exile towns and dungeons
starts with X = 0, Y = 0 (also written (0,0) ) in the upper left.</p>

<h2>Stuff Done Flags</h2>

<p>The single most important concept to master in scenario design is the Stuff Done Flag.
The Stuff Done Flags are numbers the game keeps track of, which are used by the game to
remember what the party has done in the scenario so far.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a treasure hidden somewhere, like, say, a shield. You
only want the party to be able to get that shield once, so the game needs a way to
remember that the party has gotten it.</p>

<p>This is done with a Stuff Done Flag. It is a number that starts at 0, and is matched up
with getting the shield. When the shield is reached, the game sees if the Stuff Done Flag
is 0. If it is, the shield hasn't been taken yet, so the game gives the party the shield,
and the Stuff Done Flag is set to 1. The Stuff Done Flag being 1 tells the game in the
future that the shield has been taken.</p>

<h2>Stuff Done Flags - the Specifics</h2>

<p>But what are the Stuff Done Flags? Picture a grid of numbers, 300 wide and 10 high, all
of which start at 0. These 3000 numbers are your Stuff Done Flags, and they are all set to
0 when the party starts a scenario (and are saved in the save file, which is how the game
remembers what you've done already when the save file is opened).</p>

<p>Stuff Done Flag are described by coordinates. Much as the coordinates of a spot of
terrain are given by an X and Y value, a Stuff Done Flag has coordinates too. The first
coordinate of a Stuff Done Flag is the column it is in (out of 300 columns, a number from
0 to 9), and the second coordinate of a Stuff Done Flag is the row it is in (out of 10
rows, a number from 0 to 299). For example, the taking of a shield may be attached to
Stuff Done Flag X = 112, Y = 3, also written (112,3). Later chapters often refer to the
two parts of a Stuff Done Flag (the X coordinate is the first part and the Y coordinate is
the second part). In the example, 112 is the first part, and 3 is the second part.</p>

<p>All Stuff Done Flags start as 0 when the scenario is started. For every event or thing
that must be remembered, you will need to assign a Stuff Done Flag to it. When the party
completes some mission, you may decide that (91,9) will become 1, and when a demon is
killed, (94,2) will become 1. Later, you can have special encounters check a Stuff Done
Flag, and do different things depending on what the value of the Stuff Done Flag is. For
this reason, you will want to keep careful notes on your scenario, to make sure that no
two events are linked to the same Stuff Done Flag.</p>

<h2>Keeping Notes</h2>

<p>One thing all of the Exile games have had in common is that, when they were done,
dozens of pages of careful, intricate notes had been taken about them. For example, in the
first Blades of Exile scenario, Valley of Dying Things, when you take the opening stone in
Avizo's shop, the Stuff Done Flag (1,2) is set to 250. Later, when the player tries to take
the stone, the program will see that the Stuff Done Flag (1,2) is not 0, and will know
that stone has been taken and should not be given again.</p>

<p>In the same scenario, when you kill the evil spirit in Blinlock, Stuff Done Flag (2,3)
is set to 1. Suppose, however, that the designer has made a mistake and made the Stuff
Done Flag (1,2) set to 1 when the spirit was slain. In this case, if the party killed the
spirit first (causing (1,2) to be set to 1), and then went to get the opening stone, it
wouldn't be there! (because (1,2) has been set to 1, making the game think that the item
has been taken, even if it hasn't) Then the party wouldn't be able to finish the game. This
is bad. However, careful notes reminded the designer that the Stuff Done Flag (1,2) had
already been used, and thus it wasn't used in Blinlock.</p>

<p>One useful tip for making sure Stuff Done Flags don't get reused: in town 0, only use
Stuff Done Flags with first part 0 ((0,0), (0,1), etc.). In town 1, only use Stuff Done
Flags with first part 1, and so on. For outdoor sections, use the Stuff Done Flags with
first part 200, 201, 202, and so on. This way, you can be sure when designing town 8, you
wont use a Stuff Done Flag already needed for town 4.</p>
<p>Of course, in some towns you will need to use more than 10 Stuff Done Flags. When this
happens, you can consult your notes to find Stuff Done Flags that aren't being used for
anything yet.</p>

<h2>Text Length</h2>

<p>When writing text messages or dialogue, the maximum message length is 256 characters.
If the message is too long, it will be chopped off at 256 letters.</p>

<h2>Editing Text</h2>

<p>The scenario, each town, and each outdoor section has a list of pieces of text. The
scenario has 260 pieces of text, each town has 140 pieces of text, and each outdoor
section has 108 pieces. Selecting Edit Text from the Scenario, Outdoor, and Town menus
will bring up the lists of text. To edit a piece of text, click on it. Each piece of text
in each list has a specific purpose. The meanings of the text are listed in the
appendices.</p>
<p></p>

<p>At this point, it's time to tackle the most complicated, most powerful thing in the
Blades of Exile editor, the tool that makes the differences between a bland adventure and
a masterpiece: special encounters.</p>
