<h1>Appendix B - Item Ability Types</h1>

<p>Each item type can have a special ability. The types of abilities available range from
shooting fireballs to weapons doing special damage to dragons to items being ingredients
for alchemical recipes.</p>
<p>There are two types of item abilities: usable and inherent.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Usable abilities:</b> Usable item abilities are only activated by pressing the
items use button on the PC inventory screen. Otherwise, the ability has no effect.
Examples are a wand that shoots fireballs or a healing potion.
<p>Usable abilities are always linked to the items charges. Whenever an item with a usable
ability is actually used, the items amount of charges goes down by 1. When the items
charge level goes down to 0, the item disappears. An item with a usable ability must have
at least 1 charge.</p>
<p>The cash value of an item with a usable ability is calculated differently from normal
items. The items actual cost is its value multiplied by the number of its charges.
(Example: Suppose a Potion of Healing has a value of 100 and 2 charges. This potion would
cost 200 gold and sell for half that.)</li>
<li><b>Inherent Abilities:</b>Inherent abilities are abilities that are always present and
are activated automatically, as opposed to being activated by pressing the Use button on
the PC Inventory screen. Examples are a shield with fire protection (which is activated
automatically when the character takes fire damage) or comfrey root (whose ability it that
it can be used as an alchemical ingredient, and which is used automatically when the party
tries to make a potion with it).
<p>Some inherent abilities have charges (such as alchemical ingredients). When used, the
amount of charges goes down by one. When there are no charges left, the item disappears.
The name of inherent ability types that require charges have a (c) after them.The value of
these items is calculated the same way as for Usable abilities.</p>
<p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are four different classes of item ability type, each with its own properties and
varieties of items that can possess it. Three of these classes are inherent abilities. The
categories are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='#weapon'>Weapon Abilities</a>: Abilities of this type can be given to weapons. Some of these
abilities can only be given to missiles (like darts or arrows). None of these abilities
require charges.</li>
<li><a href='#general'>General Abilities</a>: Abilities of this type can be given to non-missile items
which can be equipped (e.g. rings, armor, sword, but not arrows) but not to items that
can't (e.g. wands, potions). Only a few of these ability types require that the items
having them have charges.</li>
<li><a href='#usable'>Usable Abilities</a>: Most abilities of this type change the status of the party or
individual character in some way, such as making them more or less poisoned, or raising or
lowering health. A few instead cast a spell or have a similar effect such as summoning
monsters. Abilities of these types can be given to any item that's not a missile
(e.g. arrows, bolts). Being usable item abilities, any item having one of these abilities
must have charges.</li>
<li><a href='#reagent'>Reagents</a>: Items with these abilities are alchemical ingredients, spell
reagents (e.g. smoky crystals, sapphires), or similar substances. All items with an
ability of this type must have charges, and must be of variety Non-use Object.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, each item type has two acompanying extra data fields as well as
the Magic Item Adjust setting. For each ability, these two fields have different ranges
and different affects (the first field is usually Ability Strength), and their values will
modify the affects of the item abilities in different ways. What each ability does and how
the extra data fields and Magic Item Adjust affect it are described below.</p>

<dl class='autolink'>
<dt>Ability 0 - No ability</dt>
<dd>The item has no special ability.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id='weapon'>Weapon Abilities (Inherent)</h2>

<p>For each of these abilities, the Ability Strength is a number from 0 to 10, which
represents the strength of the ability (0 is weakest, 10 is most powerful). The Magic Item
Adjust field is ignored.</p><!-- TODO: Double-check the expected ranges -->

<dl class='autolink'>
<dt>Ability 1 - Damaging Weapon</dt>
<dd>The weapon does extra damage of the type specified in the second extra data field. The
Ability Strength is the number of d6's of extra damage done.</dt>
<dt>Ability 2 - Slayer Weapon</dt>
<dd>Does extra damage to the race specified in the second extra data field. If the
specified race is Humanoid, it also affects Sliths, Nephilim, Vahnatai, and Goblins. If
the specified race is Undead, it affects both normal and skeletal undead. The amount of
extra damage is equal to the ability strength times a race-dependent constant:
<ul>
<li>Demon, Giant, Stone, Dragon: 8</li>
<li>Bug, Plant, Slime: 7</li>
<li>Undead, Skeletal: 6</li>
<li>Reptile, Beast, Bird: 5</li>
<li>Mage, Priest, Magical: 4</li>
<li>Human, Nephil, Slith, Vahnatai, Goblin, Humanoid: 3</li>
<li>Important: 0.5</li>
</ul>
</dt>
<dt>Ability 3 - Healing Weapon</dt>
<dd>Restores health to target. The extra data fields are not used; the amount healed is
equal to the damage that would have otherwise been done.</dt>
<dt>Ability 4 - Exploding Weapon</dt>
<dd>Explodes at the target, cast at a level equal to the Ability strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 5 - Returning Missile</dt>
<dd>This missile is not used up when fired. It is best to only give it one use. This
ability cannot be given to a melee weapon. The extra data fields are not used.</dd>
<dt>Ability 6 - Farflight Missile</dt>
<dd>This missile has a greater range than others of its kind. The Ability Strength
specifies the bonus to the missile's range. This ability cannot be given to a melee
weapon.</dd>
<dt>Ability 7 - Seeking Missile</dt>
<dd>This missile seeks out its target. If aimed at an empty space, there is a chance that
it will instead target an adjacent space if there is something there. This is especially
useful when fighting invisible monsters. This ability cannot be given to a melee weapon.
The extra data fields are not used.</dd>
<dt>Ability 8 - Draining Weapon</dt>
<dd>Drains spell points from the target and restores the wielder's spell points. The
amount of SP drained is equal to the Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 9 - Status-afflicting Weapon</dt>
<dd>Afflicts some status effect on anything it hits. The second extra data field specifies
the type of status effect. If it is a beneficial status effect, the weapon will instead
drain it from the target. The amount afflicted/drained is equal to one-half the Ability
Strength. (So, an ability strength of 1 has no effect.)</dd>
<dt>Ability 10 - Soulsucker</dt>
<dd>When it hits, the wielder is healed. The amount healed is equal to one-half the Ability
Strength. (So, an ability strength of 1 has no effect.)</dd>
<dt>Ability 11 - Reserved</dt>
<dt>Ability 12 - Weak Weapon</dt>
<dd>Does less damage than usual. If Ability Strength is 10, does no damage at all.</dd>
<dt>Ability 13 - Causes Fear</dt>
<dd>Drains morale of target.</dd>
<dt>Ability 14 - Weapon Call Special</dt>
<dd>The weapon calls a special node every time it hits.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id='general'>General Abilities (Inherent)</h2>

<p>For each of these abilities (unless otherwise stated), the Ability Strength is a number
from 0 to 10, which represents the strength of the ability (0 is weakest, 10 is most
powerful). The Magic Item Adjust field is ignored.</p>

<dl class='autolink'>
<dt>Ability 30 - Protection</dt>
<dd>This partially blocks damage the wielder takes. The type of damage blocked is
specified in the second extra data field. The Ability Strength determines how much damage
is blocked. For weapon damage, the amount blocked is equal to the Ability Strength;
otherwise, it's equal to one-half the Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 31 - Full Protection</dt>
<dd>This partially blocks weapon and spell damage the wielder takes. It also protects from
poison.</dd>
<dt>Ability 32 - Melee Protection</dt>
<dd>This item behaves as armour even if it isn't. It reduces damage by a die with the
number of sides specified in Ability Strength. If the item is armour, this is on top of
the normal damage reduction of the armour.</dd>
<dt>Ability 33 - Evasion</dt>
<dd>This reduces the chance of enemies hitting you with melee attacks and non-magical
missiles. The Ability Strength determines how much less likely they are to hit, as a
percentage.</dd>
<dt>Ability 34 - Martyr's Shield</dt>
<dd>When attacked with this equipped, the enemy will take damage.</dd>
<dt>Ability 35 - Encumbering</dt>
<dd>This increases your encumbrance by an amount equal to the Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 36 - Status Protection</dt>
<dd>Protects you from a negative status effect. The type of status effect is specified in
the second extra data field. Note that if you specify a beneficial status effect, the
ability will have no effect. Whenever the specified status effect is received, it is
reduced by an amount equal to a fraction of the ability strength:
<ul>
<li>Sleep, Paralysis, Dumbfound: 1/4</li>
<li>Poison, Disease, Web, Slow, Curse: 1/2</li>
<li>Acid: 1</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if applied to the disease status effect, it makes it wear off more
quickly.</dd>
<dt>Ability 37 - Skill</dt>
<dd>Increases the wielder's chance of hitting in combat. </dd>
<dt>Ability 38 - Boost Statistic</dt>
<dd>Boosts the wielder's level in the skill specified in the second extra data field. This
cannot boost max HP or max SP. The Ability Strength is how many extra levels the wielder
gets. This cannot raise the effective level above 20. It can however raise the effective
level of Mage or Priest Spells above 7, though there's not much use in doing so - the only
thing it affects is your chance of breaking a forcecage. If applied to one of the three
basic stats (Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence), this ability increases your bonus to
to that stat by one, but the bonuses are otherwise still based on your actual level in the
stat. The Ability Strength is still relevant, however, because a few circumstances use the
modified skill level instead of the stat bonus. These circumstances are: Amount you can carry
(Strength), Hit chance in unarmed combat (Dexterity), Effectiveness in a mindduel
(Intelligence).</dd>
<dd>The wielder's bonuses due to strength are increased.</dd>
<dt>Ability 39 - Boost Combat Statistics</dt>
<dd>Like Boost Statistic, above, but applies to all combat statistics simultaneously.</dd>
<dt>Ability 40 - Boost Magic Statistics</dt>
<dd>Like Boost Statistic, above, but applies to all magic statistics simultaneously.</dd>
<dt>Ability 41 - Accuracy</dt>
<dd>Missile weapons are more accurate.</dd>
<dt>Ability 42 - Thieving</dt>
<dd>Picking locks and disarming traps is easier. </dd>
<dt>Ability 43 - Giant Strength</dt>
<dd>Improves odds of hitting and damage in combat.</dd>
<dt>Ability 44 - Lighter object</dt>
<dd>Wielder can carrier more weight. </dd>
<dt>Ability 45 - Heavier object</dt>
<dd>Wielder can carry less weight. </dd>
<dt>Ability 46 - Occasional Status Effect</dt>
<dd>Occasionally inflicts a status effect. Which status effect is specified by the second
extra data field. The Ability Strength specifies how much, and the Magic Use Type
determines whether it is beneficial or harmful. If the Magic Use Type specifies that it
affects a single character, it must be equipped to have its effect, but if the Magic Use
Type specifies that it affects the whole party, it need only be carried to have its
effect.</dd>
<dt>Ability 47 - Defensive Call Special</dt>
<dd>Calls a special node when the wearer is hit in melee combat or by a non-magical
missile.</dd>
<dt>Ability 48 - Life Saving (c)</dt>
<dd>When the wielder takes a death blow, he/she survives and is healed, and the item loses
a charge. This item must be given charges.</dd>
<dt>Ability 49 - Prot. from petrify</dt>
<dd>Reduces chance of being petrified.</dd>
<dt>Ability 50 - Regenerate</dt>
<dd>Heals wielder occasionally.</dd>
<dt>Ability 51 - Poison Augment</dt>
<dd>Wielder's weapon poison more effective. The wielder must poison their weapon first for
this ability to have any effect.</dd>
<dt>Ability 52 - Radiant</dt>
<dd>When worn, this item sometimes increases the light level around you. This can even
work in totally dark towns.</dd>
<dt>Ability 53 - Will</dt>
<dd>Wielder more effective in a mindduel, and resists sleeping and paralysis.</dd>
<dt>Ability 54 - Free Action</dt>
<dd>Wielder resists sleeping and paralysis.</dd>
<dt>Ability 55 - Speed</dt>
<dd>The wearer gets more action points in combat (powerful).</dd>
<dt>Ability 56 - Slow Wearer</dt>
<dd>The wearer gets fewer action points in combat.</dd>
<dt>Ability 57 - Protect from Species</dt>
<dd>Protects from blows received in combat from the species specified in the second extra
data field. If the specified species is Humanoid, it also protects from Sliths, Nephilim,
Vahnatai, and Goblins. If the specified species is Undead, it protects from both normal
and skeletal undead. Damage is reduced by an amount equal to one-half the Ability
Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 58 - Lockpicks</dt>
<dd>This item can be used as a lockpick. The Ability Strength determines how good a pick
it is.</dd>
<dt>Ability 59 - Drains Missiles</dt>
<dd>Drains missiles twice as fast. This is typically given to bows and crossbows.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id='usable'>Usable Abilities</h2>

<p>Most of these item abilities affect a character's statistics (e.g. health, spell
points) or status (e.g. poison, flying) when the item is used.</p>
<p>For each of these abilities, the Ability Strength is a number from 0 to 10, which
represents the strength of the ability (0 is weakest, 10 is most powerful). The meaning of
this changes depending on the ability affected. Sometimes, the number affects the
duration, sometimes the damage done.</p>
<p>The Item Use Properties buttons affect whether using the item affects just the using
character or the whole party, and whether the item helps or hurts the party.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of these abilities can only help (like Bliss) or only hurt (like Doom). For these
abilities, the Magic Item Adjust values of 0 and 1 have the same effect, and the values 2
and 3 have the same effect. Also, some abilities only affect the whole party (like Light
or Firewalk). For these abilities, setting the Magic Item Use type to affect a single PC will have the same effect as the equivalent Whole Party setting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Example: Suppose you give an item the ability Dumbfound, set Ability Strength to 2, and
Magic Item Adjust to 0. Then, when the item is used, the user's level of dumbfounding will
go down a little bit. If Ability Strength is set instead to 10, the user will be totally
cured of Dumbfounding.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose you give an item the ability Cause/Cure Acid, set Ability Strength to
5, and Magic Item Adjust to 3. When someone uses the item, the entire party gets 5 levels
of acid (which means the acid lasts about 5 turns).</p>

<dl class='autolink'>
<dt>Ability 70 - Poison Weapon</dt>
<dd>This item is a weapon poison that can be applied to the user's weapon. The Magic Use
Type is ignored, and the Ability Strength is the strength of the poison. When used, the
user has a chance (based on the Poison skill) of poisoning him/herself.</dd>
<dt>Ability 71 - Affect Status</dt>
<dd>Affects the level of a status effect on the user. Note that some pairs of status
effects are considered opposites, so that curing one is the same as afflicting its
opposite. The status effect to affect is specified in the second extra data field, and the
Ability Strength specifies how much to change it.</dd>
<dt>Ability 72 - Cast Spell</dt>
<dd>Casts a spell. The spell is cast as if by a PC of level equal to the Ability Strength
with an Intelligence bonus of 1. The second extra data field specifies which spell to
cast. For a priest spell, add 100 to the spell number. There are also some extra spells
not available to PCs that can be specified here - they have IDs 62-77 and 162-167. You can
click the Mage or Priest button to select the spell from a list. The Magic Item Adjust
setting is ignored. The additional spells are:
<ol start='62'>
<li><i>Strengthen Target</i> - Makes the target monster stronger. Still counts as an
attack, so casting it on a friendly monster will make it hostile.</li>
<li><i>Summon Rat</i> - Summons a Mung Rat.</li>
<li><i>Sphere of Frost</i> - Like the Ice Wall spell, but in a circle.</li>
<li><i>Goo Bomb</i> - Like the Web spell, but in a larger radius.</li>
<li><i>Foul Vapours</i> - Like the Stinking Cloud spell, but in a large circle.</li>
<li><i>Sleep Bomb</i> - Like the Sleep Cloud spell, but in a circle.</li>
<li><i>Acid Spray</i> - Sprays acid on target.</li>
<li><i>Paralyze Beam</i> - Like the Paralyze spell, but affects just a single target.</li>
<li><i>Mass Sleep</i> - Like Mass Paralysis, but puts all nearby monsters to sleep.</li>
<li><i>Ravage Enemies</i> - Like Slow Group, but also curses enemies.</li>
<li><i>Aura of Blades</i> - Places a circle of Blade Walls centered on the caster's location.
This will damage the caster as well as anything within range.</li>
<li><i>Icy Rain</i> - Like Firestorm, but deals cold damage.</li>
<li><i>Aura of Flames</i> - All adjacent spaces take fire damage.</li>
<li><i>Summon Aid</i> - Like Summoning, but only summons one creature.</li>
<li><i>Major Summon Aid</i> - Like Major Summoning, but only summons one creature.</li>
<li><i>Flash Step</i> - Lets you target a space and, if the space is empty, immediately
teleports the character there. Only usable in combat.</li>
<li value='162'><i>Dispel Field</i> - This differs from the two Dispel Fields spells (one
mage, one priest) in only affecting a single space.</li>
<li><i>Distance Shatter</i> - This combines the range of Move Mountains with the area
effect of Shatter, destroying any fragile walls in a 3x3 area around the target
location.</li>
<li><i>Wrack</i> - A weaker version of the Wound spell.</li>
<li><i>Unholy Ravaging</i> - Damages, slows, and poisons the targeted monster.</li>
<li><i>Augmentation</i> - Healing that may exceed your max health. If it does, the bonus
hit points slowly wear off even when you don't take any damage, and disappear entirely
when you exit town or end outdoor combat.</li>
<li><i>Nirvana</i> - Gives one player enlightenment (the inverse of dumbfounding) and
bonus spell points, which work much like bonus hit points as described above.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Ability 73 - Bliss/Doom</dt>
<dd>Bliss heals and blesses. Doom poisons, damages, diseases, dumbfounds, and drains
experience. If the Magic Use Type specifies a helpful item, it causes Bliss; otherwise,
Doom.</dd>
<dt>Ability 74 - Add/Lose Experience</dt>
<dd>Experience gained/lost is equal to 5 times Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 75 - Add/Lose Skill Pts.</dt>
<dd>Amount of skill points gained/lost is equal to Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 76 - Add/Lose Health</dt>
<dd>Amount added or lost is 10 times Ability Strength plus or minus a small random amount.
Health will not be reduced below 0. This can be as high as 20.</dd>
<dt>Ability 77 - Add/Lose Spell Points</dt>
<dd>Amount added or lost is 5 times Ability Strength plus or minus a small random
amount.</dd>
<dt>Ability 78 - Light</dt>
<dd>Affects the party light level. The Ability Strength determines how much, and the Magic
Use Type determines whether it increases or decreases the light level.</dd>
<dt>Ability 79 - Affect Party Status</dt>
<dd>Increases or decreases one of the whole-party status effects - Stealth, Firewall,
Flight or Detect Life. The second extra data field specifies which effect, and the Ability
Strength determines how much. For Stealth, the Ability Strength is multiplied by 5; for
Firewalk, it is multiplied by 2. The Magic Use Type determiens whether it increase or
decreases the status effect.</dd>
<dt>Ability 80 - Affect Health and Poison</dt>
<dd>Affects both health and poison. The amount of poison affected is equal to the Ability Strength, while the amount of health changed is equal to 25 times the Ability Strength.</dd>
<dt>Ability 81 - Call Special</dt>
<dd>Calls a special node when used.</dd>
<dt>Ability 82 - Summoning</dt>

<dd>Summons 3-5 monsters. Otherwise works just like the above ability.</dd>
<dt>Ability 84 - Quickfire</dt>
<dd>Creates quickfire on space where its used. The Magic Item Adjust setting is ignored, as
are the extra data fields..</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id='reagent'>Reagents (Inherent)</h2>

<p>To perform alchemy or cast certain spells, the alchemist/caster must have items with
certain abilities in his/her inventory. For example, to make a Weak Poison potion, the
maker must have an item with the Holly ability, or to cast a Magic Map spell, the caster
must have an item with the Sapphire ability.</p>
<p>These items must have charges, representing the number of times they can be used. The
Magic Item Adjust and Ability Strength fields are not used (except for Lockpicks).</p>
<p>The name of each ability represents the ingredient/spell component that the item with
that ability can substitute for. For example, a gem with the ability Smoky Crystal can be
used to cast Mindduel.</p>
