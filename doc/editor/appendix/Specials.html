<h2>Appendix 1 - Special Encounter Node Types</h2>

<p>These are the many types of special encounter nodes. They are divided into six
different categories, and given with examples and descriptions of what the various editing
fields do.</p>

<h3>General Use Specials</h3>
<p>This is the class of special encounters which can be called at practically any time.
Most of them can always be called. A few can't - these are noted in the encounter
description.</p>

<h4>General notes</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>Some of these nodes change a Stuff Done flag. A
Stuff Done flag is described by two values: Stuff done 1 and Stuff done 2. The legal range
of the first flag is from 0 to 299, and the range for the second flag is 0 to 9. If a
value is given outside the legal range, the special node does nothing and the Jump To node
is called next (though often the editor will give you an error when you try to do
this).</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>After a special node is called and has its effect, this field
specifies the next node to be called. If this value is negative, the special encounter
ends. There are a few exceptions to this, which are noted in the encounter description.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Type 0: No special</dt><dd>This is the default setting for all special nodes. It does
nothing. If the Jump To field contains a non-negative number, the encounter jumps to that
node.
<dl>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If you have a chain of special nodes and want to remove one of the nodes
in the middle, set its type to Null Special, and leave the Jump To value unchanged. When
the party reaches that special, and that node is reached, it just passes through to the
Jump To node.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 1: Set Flag</dt><dd>This node sets a Stuff Done flag to the desired value.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to change.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the value to change it to.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>If Stuff done 1 is set to 90, Stuff done 2 is set to 4, and Extra 1a
is set to 8, when this node is called Stuff Done (90,4) becomes 8. If, instead, Stuff done
2 is set to 40, this value is out of range (0 ... 9) and you will get an error.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 2: Increment Flag</dt><dd>This node increases (or decreases) a Stuff Done flag by
a specified amount.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to change.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the amount to increase/decrease the flag by.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If this is 0, the flag is increased by Extra 1a. If its non-zero,
the flag is decreased by that amount.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 3: Display Message</dt><dd>This vitally important special displays a dialog
window containing one (or two) text messages.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 4: Start Shopping</dt><dd>You can places stores outside using this special node
type. When called, the special encounter ends immediately (the Jumpto field is ignored),
and the party is not allowed to enter the space they were moving into. The game immediately
goes into shopping mode. Although normally used outdoors, this special node also works in
town.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Mess1:</dt><dd>This message is the name of the store the party has found.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the shop.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The item cost adjuster, a number from 0 (very cheap) to 6 (very
expensive). See chapter 11 (Dialogue) for the complete list of cost adjustments.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<dt>Type 5: Display Small Message</dt><dd>A text message is displayed on one (or two)
line(s) of the text area (in the lower right hand corner). Don't make the displayed
messages too long.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage - these are the numbers of the messages to put in
one or two lines of the text area.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 6: Flip Flag</dt><dd>This node changes a Stuff Done flag from 0 to 1 (or back).
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to change. If the flag
is 0, it's changed to 1. Otherwise, it's changed to 0.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 7: Set SDF to Random</dt><dd>Generates a random value and stores it in a Stuff Done Flag.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The minimum and maximum allowed values, respectively.</dd>
</dd>

<dt>Type 8: Addition</dt><dd>Adds values and stores the result in a Stuff Done Flag.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If Extra 1b is -1, then Extra 1a is the first value to
add. Otherwise, the first value to add is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by
these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2b is -1, then Extra 2a is the second value to
add. Otherwise, the second value to add is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by
these two fields.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 9: Subtraction</dt><dd>Subtracts values and stores the result in a Stuff Done Flag.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If Extra 1b is -1, then Extra 1a is the value to subtract
from. Otherwise, the value to subtract from is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by
these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2b is -1, then Extra 2a is the value to subtract.
Otherwise, the value to subtract is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by these two
fields.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 10: Story Dialog</dt><dd>Shows a small dialog that displays a series of messages,
one at a time.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1:</dt><dd>The number of a message to be displayed as a title in the dialog.</dd>
<dt>Mess2, Mess3:</dt><dd>The number of the first and last string to show in the dialog.</dd>
<dt>Pict, Pictype:</dt><dd>Specifies the icon to show in the dialog.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 11: Can't Enter</dt><dd>If the party is walking, they are not allowed to enter
the space. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage. If the party is not moving, no messages are
displayed.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If this is set to 1, the party is kept from entering the space. If
not 1, the party is allowed to enter the space (this undoes any Can't Enter nodes already
called).</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>Sometimes, this can be set to 1 to allow the party to enter even an
impassable space. This works under any of the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>The special is called outdoors.</li>
<li>The terrain has either the Call Special When Walk ability or the Change When Walk
ability.</li>
<li>The terrain can be boated over.</li>
<li>A special of this type is the first node in the chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to ensure success, it's recommended to put this special as the first node in
the chain if you want to allow passage through a normally impassable terrain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If you don't want a party to be able to walk down a passage (for
example, a guard won't let them), use this node.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Suppose you want a pillar the party can walk through. Place a special
encounter on the pillar, and have a node of this type be the first special node
called. Set Extra 1a to 0 and Extra 2a to 1.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>This doesn't have to be the last node in a chain. If this is the first
special node called, the party is still kept from entering the space... unless another
node of the same type undoes it.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 12: Change Time</dt><dd>This special node sets the adventure time forward.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the number of ticks to set the timer forward. A day is 3000
ticks. The maximum this can be set to is 30000.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 13: Start Global Timer</dt><dd>One of the parties special encounter timers is
activated. Each move taken, the timer goes down by 1. When it runs out, a scenario special
node is called (even if the party enters or leaves town). Also see Start Town Timer, under
Town Special Nodes.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of moves before the timer runs out. (Range 0 ...
30000)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The scenario special node to call when the timer runs out. If left
at No Special, nothing happens.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 14: Play a sound</dt><dd>Plays one of the game's sounds.
<dl>
<dt>Extra1a:</dt><dd>Which sound to play. For a list of sounds, read Appendix A.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 15: Change Horse Possession</dt><dd>Makes a horse the parties property (or not).
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra1a:</dt><dd>The horse to change ownership of. (Range 0 ... 29)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 0, the horse becomes the party's property. Otherwise, it is no
longer the party's property.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 16: Change Boat Possession</dt><dd>Like Change Horse Possession, except for
boats.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra1a:</dt><dd>The boat to change ownership of. (Range 0 ... 29)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 0, the boat becomes the party's property. Otherwise, it is no
longer the party's property.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 17: Show/Hide Town</dt><dd>This either makes a party know a town is there, or
hide it so they can't enter it anymore. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if
you wish.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the town to show/hide.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, the town becomes hidden. If not 0, the town becomes
visible.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Suppose dungeon 14 contains a big treasure, revealed by reading a
treasure map. When the map is read, call this special. Set Extra 1a to 14 and Extra 2b to
1.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 18: Major Event Has Occurred</dt><dd>A major event is recorded as having
occurred. See Passage of Time in the chapter on Special Encounters for a more detailed
explanation.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the special event. (Range 1 ... 20)</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>If the slaying of the goblin king is event 4, when it is killed, call
this special node with Extra 1a set to 4.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 19: Forced Give</dt><dd>This places an item in the party's inventory, whether or
not it's too heavy for them to carry. It only fails to give the item if there is absolutely
no room in their inventory.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the item to give. Press the Choose button to pick an
item.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The special to jump to if the item is not successfully given (if all
the party's item slots are full). If No Special is given, the Jump To special is used as
usual.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 1, the item is given pre-equipped, without checking to see if
this is legal. This should only be used if you know exactly what else they have equipped,
for example if you are creating a joined NPC or if you previously stripped them of their
items.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If you want the party to get an item after winning a combat outdoors,
use a Forced Give. This makes sure that if it is at all possible, they get it.</dd>
<dt>Uses 2:</dt><dd>Use this is the party is given an item during a talking special
encounter. If the party inventory is full, jump to a special telling them that they can't
carry the item and to come back later, and then end the special. This enables you to keep
from setting a Stuff Done flag saying they got the item, when, in fact, they
didn't.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 20: Buy Items of Type</dt><dd>All items that belong to the given special class
(described in the chapter on items) are taken from the party. For each item taken, the
party gets some gold. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage. Note that the messages are only displayed if
some items are actually taken away.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The item class to take away. (Range 1 ... 100)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The special to jump to if no items are taken. If No Special is
specified, the Jump To special is used as usual.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The amount of gold to pay for each item (Range 0 ... 250)</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>This is a how you give a bounty for items. If you want someone to give
the party 10 gold for each unicorn horn, give unicorn horns a special class of, say, 30,
and call this special node with Extra 1a set to 30 and Extra 2a set to 10.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 21: Call Global Special</dt><dd>This node does nothing itself. However, its Jump
To node specifies a scenario special node, not a town or outdoors special node. This is
how you call a scenario special node when in town or outdoors.
<dl>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Use when in town or outdoors. This can be used if you have one special
thing which you want in many towns or outdoors sections. You can place the encounter in
scenario specials once, and then just call it from the many places it's used.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 22: Set Many Flags</dt><dd>This node sets 50 Stuff Done flags to a desired
value.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1:</dt><dd>A number from 0 to 299. When this node is called, (Stuff Done 1,
0), (Stuff Done 1, 1), ... (Stuff Done 1, 49) are all set to Extra 1a.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the value to change it to.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>Suppose Stuff Done flag (200,4) is 35. This node is called with Stuff
Done 1 equal to 200, and Extra 1a set to 5. Then Stuff Done flag (200,4) will be 5 (as
will flags (200,0), (200,1), etc.).</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 23: Copy Flag</dt><dd>This sets one Stuff Done flag equal to another.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2:</dt><dd>The flag to change.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The flag to change it to.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>If Stuff Done 1 is 12, Stuff Done 2 is 5, Extra 1a is 8, and Extra 1b
is 8, then the value of Stuff Done flag (12,5) becomes the same as Stuff Done flag
(8,8).</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 24: Display Picture</dt><dd>Shows a dialog with a large picture and a title.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1:</dt><dd>The number of a message containing a title string to show in the
dialog.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the graphics sheet to show. See the chapter on custom
graphics for details on what a graphics sheet is and how to get the game to see it. This
special node displays the entire sheet in a dialog, so the sheet can be whatever size you
want.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 25: Have a rest</dt><dd>If the party is in combat or if the party is in town and
there was just combat going on, nothing happens. Otherwise, the party gets rested. Some
time passes, and their health and spell points are restored.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of ticks that pass (a day is 3000 ticks)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The amount of health and spell points to restore.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 26: Wandering Will Fight</dt><dd>This special node only has an effect if called
when the party has just encountered a group of monsters outdoors. If called at any other
time, it has no effect. The node determines whether the monsters in the group will
actually attack the party or not.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If this is set to 0, the monsters will not attack the party, and the
outdoor encounter will simply end. If its non-zero, the monsters will attack the
party.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Suppose a group of soldiers outdoors will only attack the party if they
have the stolen Wand of Balloo. If they don't have it, use this node with Extra 1a set to
0. If you don't call a special node of this type, the soldiers will attack.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 27: End Scenario</dt><dd>Every scenario should call a node of this type at least
once. When called, the scenario immediately ends, and the player will be returned to the
starting screen, with the option of saving the game.
<dl>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Without a node of this sort, the player's only option for leaving the
scenario is to use the character editor. Please make sure a node of this sort can always
be reached.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 28: Set Pointer</dt><dd>This sets a pointer to point to a Stuff Done Flag.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2:</dt><dd>The flag to point to.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>Which pointer to set. There are 100 pointers you can change, and
they range from 100 to 199. To use the pointer in another node, put the negative of this
number in the field.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 29: Set/Retrieve Campaign Flag</dt><dd>This allows you to set or retrieve
information that persists between scenarios. Campaign flags are a lot like stuff done
flags, except that each scenario only gets 25x25 flags. (If you need more, you can pretend
to be multiple scenarios.)
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2:</dt><dd>The flag to store or change.</dd>
<dt>Mess1:</dt><dd>If set to a positive number, this is the number of a string used to
look up the campaign flag. If left at -1, the name of your scenario is used.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b</dt><dd>The campaign flag to fetch or change. Each of thes must be
in the range 0..24.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>Set this to 0 to set the Campaign Flag equal to the value of the
Stuff Done Flag. Set it to 1 to instead set the Stuff Done flag equal to the value of the
Campaign Flag.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If your scenario is part of a series of scenarios forming a campaign,
this allows you to share state between the scenarios.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 30 - Debug Print Numbers</dt><dd>This is a utility node for debugging your
scenario. If debug mode is not enabled, it does nothing. If debug mode is enabled, it
prints out three numbers to the text area, much like Display Small Message.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2</dt><dd>If Pict is 0, this is the flag to print. The three
numbers printed will be Part A, Part B, and the value of the flag.</dd>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>If set to 0, print a Stuff Done Flag. If set to 1, print any three
values you want. If set to 2, print a monster's health and magic points.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b, Extra 1c:</dt><dd>If Pict is 1, these are the three values
printed. Typically you'll want to use pointers here to reference some Stuff Done Flags. If
Pict is 2, then Extra 1a is the number of the monster to check and Extra 1b and Extra 1c
are ignored. The number to put here is the number shown as the "Creature number" in the
Edit Townperson dialog. The three numbers printed are the creature number, its current hit
points, and its current magic points.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 31: Multiplication</dt><dd>Multiplies values and stores the result in a Stuff
Done Flag.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If Extra 1b is -1, then Extra 1a is the first value to
multiply. Otherwise, the first value to add is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified
by these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2b is -1, then Extra 2a is the second value to
multiply. Otherwise, the second value to add is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified
by these two fields.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 32: Division</dt><dd>Divides values and stores the results in Stuff Done Flags.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If Extra 1b is -1, then Extra 1a is the value to divide
from. Otherwise, the value to divide from is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by
these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2b is -1, then Extra 2a is the value to divide
by. Otherwise, the value to divide by is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by
these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c, Extra 2c</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done Flag to store the remainder of the
division in. You can leave these are -1 if you don't care about the remainder. Similarly,
you can leave Stuff Done 1 and 2 at -1 if you only care about the remainder.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 33: Exponentiation</dt><dd>Raises a number to a power and stores the result in a
Stuff Done Flag. Note that the maximum value that can be stored in a Stuff Done Flag is
255, and this special node has no way to get around that.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>This is the Stuff Done flag to store the result
in.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If Extra 1b is -1, then Extra 1a is the value to raise to
a power. Otherwise, the value to raise to a power is the value of the Stuff Done Flag
specified by these two fields.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2b is -1, then Extra 2a is the power to raise to.
Otherwise, the power to raise to is the value of the Stuff Done Flag specified by these
two fields.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 34: Change Terrain</dt><dd>Changes a space to a given terrain type.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the desired space.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of the terrain type to change it to. Press the Choose
button to select a terrain type.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 35: Swap Terrain</dt><dd>Changes a space from a given terrain type to another,
or back.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the desired space.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of a terrain type. If the given space is of this type,
change it to the type in Extra 2b.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The number of a terrain type. If the given space is of this type,
change it to the type in Extra 2a.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 36: Transform Terrain</dt><dd>If the terrain in a given space has a terrain type
given in the Transform To What field, it is changed to that terrain type.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space to
transform.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 37: Clear String Buffer</dt><dd>Clears the string buffer. It's best to always do
this before you use the buffer. The buffer is never automatically cleared, but it is not
saved, so if the user reloads from a saved game, anything that was in the buffer may be
lost.</dd>

<dt>Type 38: Append String to Buffer</dt><dd>Appends a literal string to the string buffer.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the string to append.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 39: Append Number to Buffer</dt><dd>Appends a literal number to the string buffer.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number to append. You might want to reference a pointer
here.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 40: Append Monster/PC Name to Buffer</dt><dd>Appends the name of a monster or PC
to the string buffer.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the monster type whose name you want to append. If
left at 0, the game will instead use the currently selected target from the Select Target
node, which can be either a monster or a PC.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 41: Append Item Name to Buffer</dt><dd>Appends the name of an item type to the
string buffer.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the item type whose name you want to append.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, append the unidentified name. If 1, append the full identified
name. If 2, don't append the name; instead append the info string that would be shown for
the item in a shop or get items dialog.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 42: Append Terrain Name to Buffer</dt><dd>Appends the name of a terrain type to
the string buffer.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the terrain type whose name you want to
append.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 43: Pause</dt><dd>Pause the action for some amount of time. This could be useful
in a cutscene, for example.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the length of time to pause, measured in
milliseconds.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 44: Start Conversation</dt><dd>This special node allows you to force a
conversation to start. You can use it if you want someone other than the party to initiate
the conversation, or if you want a conversation outdoors. If you use this outdoors, you
should avoid specifying a personality that can call a town special node, as this is likely
to cause the game to crash since it won't know which town to get the node from.

personality is defined as part of a town; see the chapter on Dialogue for
details.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 45: Update Quest</dt><dd>This special node allows you to set the status of one of
the scenario's quests or jobs.
<dl>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The quest to update.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The new status for the quest:
<ol start='0'>
<li>Marks the quest as not started. This might be useful if the quest is on a job board
and you want it to be repeatable. Note however that marking a quest available does not
grant automatic rewards.</li>
<li>Marks the quest as started. If it wasn't already started, the game automatically fills
in the quest's start day, and if Extra 2a is non-negative, the quest is considered to have
come from the job board with that number.</li>
<li>Marks the quest as complete. If the quest specifies automatic rewards, the game grants
these to the party.</li>
<li>Marks the quest as failed. If it came from a job board, the game increases the anger
level of that job board. You can set Extra 2a if you want to increase the anger level even
more. A job board won't offer any jobs if its anger level is 50 or more.</li>

<h3>One-Shot Specials</h3>

<p>This is the class of specials you generally only want to occur one time, such as giving
items.</p>
<p>For each of these special node types, you can specify a Stuff Done flag in the Stuff
Done 1 and Stuff Done 2 fields. If you do, when the node is called, if that flag has a
value of 250, the node does nothing and the special ends immediately. If the flag is not
250, the node has the desired effect, and then that Stuff Done flag is set to 250 (so this
node has no effect is called again).</p>
<p>These nodes have one more special property. If you have a have a special encounter
marked by a white dot, the first node called from that special encounter is a One-Shot
Special, and the specified Stuff Done flag in that node is 250, then the white dot
disappears. Thus, specials that don't do anything anymore aren't marked by a special
dot.</p>

<h4>General notes:</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>All of these nodes change a Stuff Done flag. A
Stuff Done flag is described by two values: Stuff done 1 and Stuff done 2. The legal range
of the first flag is from 0 to 299, and the range for the second flag is 0 to 9. You can
give a value outside the legal range (such as -1 for Stuff Done 1). If you do this, the
special node does its job normally, and if this node is called again, it will do it again.
This is sometimes a good idea.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>This works as before, with one exception. If the specified Stuff Done
flag for the called node is 250, the special encounter ends and the Jump To field is
ignored.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Type 50: Give Item</dt><dd>An item is given to the party (specifically, to the first
character who can carry it). Gold and food can also be given. If the party cannot carry
another item, the Stuff Done flag is not set to 250. This can be accompanied by one or two
messages, if you wish.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage. If the items cannot be taken, no messages are

<dt>Type 52: One-Time Do Nothing</dt><dd>If the Stuff Done flag is set to 250, this node
ends the special encounter. Otherwise, it just calls the Jump To node.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>This is provided for one time encounters that don't fit into any of the
other types. Some other special node must set the Stuff Done flag to 250 to get the
encounter to disappear.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 53: One-Time Nothing and Set</dt><dd>If the Stuff Done flag is set to 250, this
node ends the special encounter. Otherwise, it sets the Stuff Done flag to 250 and calls
the Jump To node.

<dt>Type 54: One-Time Text Message</dt><dd>Displays one or two message strings.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 55: Display Dialog (Dialog pic)</dt><dd>This very important special node displays
a dialog box with up to six text messages and a dialog picture (which you choose) in the
upper left. The lower right hand corner can have 1 to 3 buttons. The player must press a
button, at which point another special node will be called. You choose a special node to
call for each button.<br>
The first button is always labeled OK if its the only button or Leave if there are other
buttons. If the first button is pressed, the Jump To special is called normally. Otherwise
the special node in Extra 1b or 2b is called.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual, with one exception. If the first button
is pressed, the Stuff Done flag is not set to 250. Otherwise, it is.</ddL
<dt>Mess 1:</dt><dd>The number of the first message to be displayed in the dialog box. The
six messages starting with this message will be displayed in the dialog box (though the
strings can, of course, be blank). Press the create/edit button to edit the text.</dd>
<dt>Mess 3:</dt><dd>This determines whether the default OK/Leave button appears. If this
is 1, this button appears. Otherwise, it doesn't.</dd>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>This is the number of the picture to display. To select a picture, press
the Choose button.</dd>
<dt>Pictype:</dt><dd>This specifies the type of picture to display. To select a picture
type, press the Choose button.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>Determines what the second button is labeled. If left -1, there is
no second button. Press the Choose button to select a label.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>What special node to call is button 2 is pressed.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>Determines what the third button is labeled. If left -1, there is no
third button. Press the Choose button to select a label.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>What special node to call is button 3 is pressed.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>If Mess 1 is 30, and Mess 2 is 4, the dialog box that comes up
contains messages 30 through 33.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>A dialog box can only contain consecutive text messages. You can't bring
up a dialog box which contains message 24, followed by messages 1, 20, and 64.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>Suppose to want a dialog box to come up displaying messages 37
through 40.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>This is one special node where you may often want to leave Stuff Done 1
at -1 (so this node displays the dialog box every time its called). For example, if you
want the text of a book to come up when the party looks at a certain bookshelf, you
probably want the same text to keep coming up when the look at the bookshelf later
on.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 58: Give Item (Dialog pic)</dt><dd>Displays a dialog box with up to six text
messages and a dialog picture (which you choose) in the upper left. At the lower right
hand corner are two buttons: Take and Leave. If take is pressed, the party is given an
item (if the item can be carried). If the item is taken, the Stuff Done flag is set to
250, and a specified special node will then be called. Otherwise, the special encounter
ends immediately and the Stuff Done flag is not set.

<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The special to jump to if the item is taken (note that this is
different from the Give Item special node, above). If No Special is given, the Jump To

<dt>Type 61: One-Time Place Outdoor Encounter</dt><dd>This node only has an effect when
called while walking outdoors. It places a special outdoor wandering encounter in a random
open space near the party. This can be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.

be accompanied by one or two messages, if you wish.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage.</dd>

9)</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 63: Trap</dt><dd>Brings up a dialog saying the party has found a trap, and asking
if they want to disarm it. If they say no, the special ends immediately, and, if they're
walking, they can't enter the space. Otherwise, they must select a character to disarm it.
Once disarmed (or triggered) the Jump To special is called. This node only has an effect
in town or combat (no traps outdoors). <!-- TODO: Check this -->
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>As usual.</dd>
<dt>Mess1, Mess2:</dt><dd>Standard usage. You can provide customized text saying the party
sees what may be a trap. If both of these fields are left at -1, the game displays a

<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The disarming penalty. The higher the number, the harder to disarm.
(Range 0 ... 100)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If trap type is 13 (custom), this scenario special node is called
when the PC fails to disarm the trap. It is never called if the PC successfully disarms
the trap.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>If this special node is placed on a container (like a chest), the party
must disarm the trap to be able to take any of the items in the chest.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Affect PC/Party/Monster Specials</h3>
<p>All of these special encounters do something to one character, to the party, or to a
monster. Who they affect depends on several factors.</p>
<p>Special node 80 (Select a Target) asks the player to select one of their PCs. Once this
node is called, any Affect PC/Party special nodes called only affect the selected PC. This
node can also be used to select a specific monster as a target</p>
<p>Special node 105 (Create a PC) sets the new PC to be the selected PC, so that any
Affect nodes called afterwards affect the new PC.</p>
<p>If no Select Target or Create PC node has been called, the node usually affects the
entire party, but there are several exceptions to this. If the special node was called as
a result of killing or seeing a monster, that monster is considered to be selected. If the
special node was called as part of an attack, the attacker is considered to be selected.
Finally, if the special was called as a result of targeting a monster (or PC) with a
spell, or as a result of using a space that happened to have a monster (or PC) on it, that
target is considered to be selected.</p>
<p>Finally, the last few nodes in this section (like Party Status, Affect Gold, etc) only
affect the whole party; they ignore the currently selected target.</p>
<p>Note that when one of these specials does something bad (e.g. diseases or poisons) a
character, all resistances (e.g. protection from poison rings) apply.</p>

<h4>General notes:</h4>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd> None of these special node types use these
fields.</dd>
<dt>Mess 1, Mess 2:</dt><dd>All of these special node types (except Select a PC) can
display one or two messages. If you don't want a message displayed, just leave these at
-1.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>This field usually affects whether the node helps of hurts the
party. In general, if its 0 (the default) it helps. Otherwise, it hurts.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>When these nodes are called during combat, if this is 0, the node
only affects the active PC. Otherwise, it affects the whole party. (Exception to this -
the Do Damage node type)</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>All of these special node types use this field.</dd>

<dl>

<dt>Type 80: Select a Target</dt><dd>Brings up a window asking the player to select a living
character. Once this is called, any Affect nodes during this special encounter only affect
the selected character. Also, instead of bringing up a window, there are several
non-interactive options.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>if this is left at 0 (the default), only living characters may be
selected. If it is set to 1, any character (dead or alive) can be picked. If it is set to
2, no choice dialog comes up, Instead, any previous PC selections are undone, and any
further Affect specials called during this special encounter affect the whole party. If
this is set to 3, only dead characters may be selected. If set to 4, only living
characters with at least one empty space in their inventory can be selected.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>This special is called if the Cancel button on the select PC dialog
box is pressed. If this is left at No Special, when the Cancel button is pressed the
special encounter immediately ends.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If left at 0, the party is allowed to select a PC matching the
requested criteria. If set to 1, a random PC matching the criteria is selected, and the
node in Extra 1b is called if none was found. If set to 2, a specific character is
selected.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If Extra 2a is set to 2, this specifies which character to select.
Use 0-5 to select a specific PC. To select a monster, look up its unique number by
locating it in town, editing it, and checking the "Creature number" field. Add 100 to that
number, and put it in this field. If the selected PC or monster does not match the
criteria set in Extra 1a, then the selected character is not changed and the special in
Extra 1b is called. You can also put a unique PC ID (which is 1000 or greater) in this
field. If you leave this at -1, the game will take the value in Extra 2c plus 1000 as the
unique PC ID to select. By using a unique PC ID, you can affect a stored PC without first
unstoring it. Setting Extra 1b to -1 should be done if you have the ID in a Stuff Done
Flag; then you'd place a pointer to that SDF in Extra 1c.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If you want something to increase the strength of one character, call a
Select a PC node, followed by an Affect Statistic node.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 81: Do Damage</dt><dd>This special node damages a character, or the whole party.
It has no effect when called during a talking special. When called during combat, and a
Select a PC node has not been called, it only affects the active character.
<dl>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>If this is 0, this node damages the whole party. If this is 1, and the
node is called during combat, only the current pc is damaged. Otherwise, the whole party
is damaged.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>This is the number of dice of damage that is rolled. (Maximum:
256)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>This is the number of sides of the dice that are rolled. For
example, if Extra 1a is 5 and Extra 2b is 8, the game generates 5 random numbers from 1 to
8, adds them, and does that much damage. (Maximum: 256)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>This is the amount of extra damage to add. If this is 100, for
example, 100 extra points of damage are inflicted.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>This is the type of damage inflicted (0 - weapon, 1 - fire, 2 -
poison, 3 - general magic, 4 - unblockable, 5 - cold, 6 - demon,7 - undead)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2c:</dt><dd>If non-zero, this specifies which sound to play along with the
damage. Leave it at 0 to use the default sound.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 82: Affect Health</dt><dd>Increases/decreases health. Health can be changed to a
maximum of 250 or a minimum of 0. This special cannot kill anybody, only reduce their
health to 0.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount to raise/lower health.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, health is raised. Otherwise, its lowered.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 83: Affect Spell Points</dt><dd>Increases/decreases spell points. Spell points
can be changed to a maximum of 100 or a minimum of 0.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount to raise/lower spell points.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, spell points are raised. Otherwise, theyre lowered.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 84: Affect Experience</dt><dd>Adds/drains experience. If the target is a monster,
this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount of experience to add/take. (Range 0 ... 100)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, adds experience. Otherwise, drains.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Use sparingly, especially when draining.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 85: Affect Skill points</dt><dd>Adds/drains skill points. If the target is a
monster, this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of skill points to add/take. (Range 0 ... 10)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, adds skill points. Otherwise, drains.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Use sparingly, especially when draining.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 86: Kill/Raise</dt><dd>Affects a PC's main status, such as "dead", "alive", or
"fled combat". If the target is a monster, "dead" and "dust" are the same, and "fled" and
"absent" are ignored.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If field Extra 1b is non-zero, this field is ignored. Otherwise,
this is the type of death inflicted: 0 - regular death, 1 - dust, 2 - stoned.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, makes the PC/Party intact again (not dead, stoned, etc.)
Otherwise, kills/stones the PC/party.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>If 0, the PC/Party gets no saving throw to resist the effect (for
example, from luck or protection from petrification items). If 1, the PC/Party is allowed
a saving throw.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Needless to say, this should be used very carefully. Nothing makes a
scenario unpleasant faster than lots of arbitrary death.</dd>
<dt>Advanced:</dt><dd>This special node has a few advanced features. If you set Extra 1a
to 3, you can mark a PC as having fled combat, or even bring them back from this state
(this only works in outdoor combat). If you set Extra 1a to 4, you can temporarily split
the PC off from the party, or bring them back; you can also bring back a PC this way after
using a Split Party node, allowing  for more advanced party splitting. (Note that Reunite
Party won't work unless a Split Party node has been called.) Finally, if you set Extra 1a
to 5, you can delete or undelete a PC.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 87: Affect Status Effect</dt><dd>Afflicts or cures a status effect on the party.
Note, if harming the party, all resistances apply. You don't need to worry about whether
the chosen status effect is inherently helpful or harmful - the game knows this, so just
set Extra 1b to 0 if you want to help the party or 1 if you want to harm them.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount to change. (Usually ranges is 0 ... 8; Martyr's Shield is
0 ... 10, and paralysis is 0 ... 5000)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, helps. Otherwise, harms.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>Which status effect. Press the Choose button to select one.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>If you affect their forcecage status, a forcecage barrier will
automatically be placed on the space. However, if you reduce their forcecage status to 0,
it won't work because being in a forcecage barrier will reset their status. To free them
from a forcecage, you should instead use Place Fields with the "Cleanse" type.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 88: Affect Traits</dt><dd>Adds or removes a special trait. If the target is a
monster, this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The trait to add or remove. Click the Choose button to select one.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, gives the trait. Otherwise, removes it.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Adding or removing a trait sets the experience needed to level up to the
value it would have been if they had always had that trait, though it does not alter the
PC's level. Also, always set Extra 1b to 0 to give a trait, even if it's a harmful
one.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 89: Affect Action Points</dt><dd>Adds or removes action points.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>How many action points.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, adds action points. Otherwise, removes.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 90: Affect Name</dt><dd>Alters a PC or monster name.
<dl>
<dt>Mess3:</dt><dd>The number of the string containing the new name.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 91: Affect Level</dt><dd>Alters the experience level of a monster or PC.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of levels to add/remove.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, gains levels. Otherwise, removes.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt>Use sparingly, especially when draining. If affecting a PC, this does not
change skill points or amount of experience.</dd>

<dt>Type 92: Affect Morale</dt><dd>Changes a monster's morale. If the target is not a
monster, this has no effect. Decreasing morale is the same as a Fear spell.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount to increase/decrease morale.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b: If 0, increases. Otherwise, decreases.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 95: Affect Soul Crystal</dt><dd>Records the currently targeted monster in the
party's soul crystal, or erases it if there is already a monster of the same kind recorded.
If the current target is not a monster, this has no effect. If you know the type of the
monster you want to record, then you need to first place one on the map, record it in the
soul crystal, and finally remove it from the map.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If 0, records. Otherwise, erases.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, the monster is given a chance to resist. If 1, the capture is
forced.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Recording a monster works exactly as a successful casting of Capture
Soul on it, meaning that a random existing monster will be erased if necessary to make
room. Multispace monsters, monsters of the Important race, and monsters with the Splits
special ability will not be recorded.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 95: Affect Monster Target</dt><dd>Changes the monster's current target. If the
target is not a monster, this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The new target (same as Extra 1b in Select a Target)</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 96: Affect Monster Attack</dt><dd>Changes the strength of one of a monster's
attacks. If the target is not a monster, this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The attack to change. (Range 0 ... 2)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The amount to change the number of dice. (0 to leave it
unchanged.)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>The amount to change the number of sides. (0 to leave it
unchanged.)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 0, increase strength. Otherwise, decrease.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 97: Affect Monster Statistic</dt><dd>Changes one of a monster's inherent
statistics. If the target is not a monster, this has no effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The amount to increase/decrease. (Range 0 ... 7)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If 0, increase. Otherwise, decrease.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The statistic to increase/decrease: 0 - max health, 1 - max magic,
2 - armor, 3 - skill, 4 - speed, 5 - mage spells, 6 - priest spells, 7 - magic resistance,
8 - fire resistance, 9 - cold resistance, 10 - poison resistance</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 98: Affect Statistic</dt><dd>Changes the character's statistics (e.g. Strength,
Mage Spells, etc.)
<dl>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>This is a number from 1 to 100, which represents the percentage chance

<dt>Type 105: Create New PC</dt><dd>This special node adds an entirely new PC to the party.
After this node is called, the new PC is considered to be the selected PC, and any
subsequent Affect nodes will apply only to the new PC.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1, Stuff Done 2:</dt><dd>If these are set to something other than -1, this
SDF is set to the unique ID of the new PC, minus 1000. If you want to do anything with
this PC after the current node chain ends, you need to set these. It's not sufficient to
just keep track of which slot the PC was placed in, because the player can rearrange their

SDF is set to the unique ID of the stored PC, minus 1000. Only leave these unset if you
already know the unique ID (for example, because you obtained it when creating the PC with
the above node). If you don't know the unique ID of the stored PC, there is no way to
unstore it.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If you set this to 1, the PC is not stored, but the SDF (if present)
is updated.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>This could be used if you have an NPC that joins the party, and you want
the NPC to leave at some point and later return to the party.</dd></dd>

PCs.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<h3>If-Then Specials</h3>
<p>These special node types don't do anything by themselves. Instead, they choose from
several choices which node to call next. For example, if you want something to happen when
the party has the Crown of Might and something different to happen when they don't, you
would use an If-Then special, which would lead to two different special nodes, one for
when they have the crown, and one for when they don't.</p>
<p>All of these nodes can be used for any type of special. All of them require selecting a
new special node (or nodes) in the Extra 1b and/or Extra 2b fields. If No Special is
selected in both of these fields, the Jump To special node is called.</p>
<p>Some of these special nodes depend on the target selected with the Select Target
special node, either always or as an option. This will be explicitly mentioned where it
applies.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Type 130: Stuff Done Flag?</dt><dd>Calls new nodes depending on the value of a given
Stuff Done flag. If the Stuff Done flag is greater than the value of Extra 1a, the special
in Extra 1b is called. Otherwise, if the Stuff Done flag is less than the value in Extra
2a, the special in Extra 2b is called. If neither case applies, the Jump To special is
called.
<p>The default values for Extra 1a is -1. If it is left at -1, it isn't checked, and the
special in Extra 1b won't be called. The same is true for Extra 2a.</p>

Extra 1b is called.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>This is called if the party is not in a town, or not in the town in
Extra 1a.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 132: Random Number?</dt><dd>Result depends on a randomly generated number. The
game will pick a random number from 1 to 100.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If the random number is less than this value, the special in Extra
1b is called.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 134: Stuff Done Compare?</dt><dd>Calls new nodes depending on whether one Stuff
Done flag is greater than another or not. If the first Stuff Done flag is greater than or
equal to the second, the special in Extra 2b is called. Otherwise, the Jump To special is
called.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>Specifies the first Stuff Done flag.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>Specifies the second Stuff Done flag.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The special to jump to if the second flag is less than the
first.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>Stuff Done flag (1,8) is 15. Stuff Done Flag (2,3) is 5. If this node
is called with Stuff Done 1 equal to 1, Stuff Done 2 equal to 8, Extra 1a equal to 2, and
Extra 1b equal to 3, then, as (1,8) is higher than (2,3), the special in Extra 2b will be
called.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 135: Terrain this type?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether a specified spot is of
a given terrain type.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the desired space.</dd>

type, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Suppose a guard opens a gate for the party, and tells them he opened it.
First, you might want to check if the gate is already opened, so that he can get angry and
tell them he already opened it.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 136: Is alive?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether the currently selected target is
alive.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If -1, the node succeeds if the target is alive. You can also set
this to any of the values accepted by the Kill/Raise node to check if the PC is dead,
dust, stone, etc. If the selected target is a monster, setting this to anything other than
-1 will make the test automatically fail.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The special node to call if the test succeeds. If Extra 1a is -1,
this is called if the target is alive.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>If the test fails, this special is called.</dd></dd>

<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If the party has at least this much gold, the special is Extra 1b is
called.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If this is 1, the gold is taken from the party. If 0, it isn't
taken.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If someone is selling, say, Strength improvement, you can first use this
to see if the party has enough gold to afford it.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>This node (and the next four) are the only If-Then nodes that
(potentially) actually have an effect in the game.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 138: Has Food?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether the party has enough food.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If the party has at least this much food, the special is Extra 1b is

<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If this is 1, the item is taken from the PC. If 0, it isn't taken.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>This is a great special to implement tickets to enter somewhere. Create
a ticket item with a special class of, say, 20. Have this special take one item of class
20. If the party has none, have Jump To point to a special node telling them they have no
ticket and blocking them from entering.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 144: Has Alchemy?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether the party knows a particular
alchemical recipe.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the desired spot.</dd>

called.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 145: Has Status Effect?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether the selected target is
afflicted with a particular status effect.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>Which status effect to check for.</dd>

explanation).
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The day some special thing is supposed to happen.</dd>

<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Suppose an altar is destroyed on day 50, if the Demon Fred is not killed
by them. Let the killing of the demon Fred be event 3 (so, when Fred is killed, a Major
Event Has Happened special is called).

For example, if this is 2, the special in Extra 1b will be called if there are at least as
many PCs of the required race as specified in Extra 2a.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>If there are less PCs than the required number in the party, but all of
them are of the required species, then the special node in Extra 1b is still called. If
this is undesirable, check the party size first.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 152: Has Trait?</dt><dd>Result depends on whether a living PC has a particular
trait. This works just like the above node, but checks for a trait instead of a species.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The trait to check for.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>This special is called if there is the number of living PCs with the
specified trait compares favourably with the required number in Extra 2a.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b</dt><dd>As in the above node.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>

-1, only the currently selected PC from the Select Target node is checked. If 0, the skill
levels of all living PCs are added up. If 1, the skill levels of all living PCs are
averaged. If 2, it takes only the PC with the minimum level in the skill. If 3, the
maximum level.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Don't make the required amount be much higher than 20. In fact, it's
generally best to never make it higher than 20, since there's a possibility that the party
will have only one PC.</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>Checking if the party has enough mage lore to decipher an ancient scroll
and learn a new spell.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 154: Text response?</dt><dd>This is one of the most complicated and powerful
special nodes. It brings up a dialog box asking the party to type in some text (such as
the answer to a ridder, or a password). If the response matches one of two given text
messages, a specified special node is called.
<dl>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>This is a number from 1 to 10. It is the number of characters the
players answer has to match the correct answer to be accepted. If it is 4, the first four
characters of the players answer must match the first four characters of the correct
answer.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of a scenario special message (not</dt><dd>a town or
outdoor special message).</dd?
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If the players answer matches the message in Extra 1a, this special
is called.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of a scenario special message (not</dt><dd>a town or
outdoor special message).</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If the players answer matches the message in Extra 1a, this special
is called.</dd>
<dt>Jump To:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>To create the scenario message containing the correct answer, select
Edit Scenario Text from the Scenario menu. Scroll down to messages 160-259, the special
encounter messages, and select one that begins with an * (i.e. is unused). Put the correct
answer to the question there. The number of that message (160-259) is the number to put in
the Extra 1a/Extra 2a field.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt><dd>A pixie asks a riddle whose answer is cheese. Scenario message 185 is
cheese. Message 1 says the pixie's riddle. Extra 1a is 185, Extra 1b is the special node
with the result of correct answering of the riddle, and Jump To leads to the node with the
result of an incorrect answer.
<p>If pict is set to 4, only the first 4 characters of the players answer are looked at.
Thus, cheese, cheer, and cheep would count as right answers. Chew, however, would
not.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Letter case is ignored. ChEeSe would be counted as a correct answer,
even is the correct answer was CHEese.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 155: Stuff done equal?</dt><dd>If the specified Stuff Done flag is equal to the
value given in Extra 1a, the special in Extra 1b is called. Otherwise, the Jump To special
is called.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>Specifies the Stuff Done flag to inspect.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If the Stuff Done flag equals this value, call special in Extra
1b.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 156: If Context?</dt><dd>Result depends on how the special node was called.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The context to test for. Click Choose to select one. If you want to
check whether the party is in town, in combat, or outdoors, you probably want one of the
first three options. To test for Ritual of Sanctification, use the Targeting Spell option
and set Extra 1b to 108. Most of these contexts arise from special nodes assigned while
editing monsters, items, town details, and other things, rather than special nodes
assigned to a terrain space.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The meaning of this field depends on the context. Usually it's not
used. For the three movement contexts, 0 means you can enter the space and 1 means you
can't. For the targeting spell context, setting this to something other than -1 means that
the special in Extra 1c will only be called if the spell that was cast is equal to the
spell that has the given number. Add 100 to indicate a priest spell. Item-only spells such
as Wrack or Strengthen Target can also be tested for; just enter the same spell ID you
would enter for the item ability.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 157: If Numeric Response?</dt><dd>Result depends on a number entered by the player.
<!-- TODO: Document this. -->
</dd>

<dt>Type 158: In Boat?</dt><dd>Result depends whether the player is in a boat.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If left at -1, the special in Extra 1c is called if the player is in
any boat. Otherwise, the special in Extra 1c is only called if the player is in the boat
with that number.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 158: On Horse?</dt><dd>Result depends whether the player is on horseback.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If left at -1, the special in Extra 1c is called if the player is on
any horses. Otherwise, the special in Extra 1c is only called if the player is on the
horses with that number.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 159: Quest Status?</dt><dd>Result depends on the status of a quest.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The quest to check.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>If the quest has this status (0 - not started, 1 - started, 2 -
completed, 3 - failed), the special in Extra 1c is called.</dd>
<dt>Jumpto:</dt><dd>Otherwise, this special is called.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Town Mode Specials</h3>
<p>These special nodes only have an effect in town mode (where most of the game takes
place). If called outdoors, all of these nodes immediately jump to the Jump To
special.</p>
<p>For all of these special types, unless the description specifically says it ends the
special encounter, once done, each node calls the Jump To node.</p>

<h4>General notes:</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Mess 1, Mess 2:</dt><dd>All of these special node types can display one or two
messages. If you don't want a message displayed, just leave these at -1.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt>Type 170: Town Hostile</dt><dd>When called, all friendly people in the town
immediately turn hostile. This node can also be used for other mass attitude changes.
Extra 1a and Extra 1b indicate the endpoints of a range of monsters to affect (counting
based on their internal location in the game), and Extra 2a is the target attitude.
<dl>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>This node may yet change drastically, so you should be wary of using it
for anything other than its original purpose.</dd></dd>

<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the source location.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the target location. If there
is a multispace monster on that location, the missile target is adjusted to target the
centre of the monster rather than the centre of this space.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>Determines how the missile's path is calculated. Allowed values are
0 or 1. <!-- TODO: Determine what the difference actually is. --></dd>
<dt>Extra 2c:</dt><dd>The number of a sound to play during the animation.</dd></dd>

the default for the explosion type. (For custom explosions, the default is none.)</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>This does nothing if called when in talking mode.</dd></dd>

one, or use one of the following special values. If this is 0, all creatures disappear.
If -1, only friendly creatures disappear. If -2, only hostile creatures disappear.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 184: Generic Lever</dt><dd>A dialog box comes up saying the party has found a
lever, and asking if they want to pull it. The dialog buttons are Yes and No. If the No
button is pressed, the Jump To special is used. If the Yes button is pushed, the terrain
in the special space is turned to its Transform To What type (if this special is called
while looking or moving, not talking), and the special node specified in Extra 1b is
called.</dd>

<dt>Type 185: Generic Portal</dt><dd>A dialog box comes up saying the party has found a
portal, and asking if they want to enter it. The dialog buttons are Enter and Leave. If
the Leave button is pressed, the Jump To special is called. Otherwise, the party is moved,
and the special encounter ends.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space the party is
teleported to if the player pushes Enter.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Like all party moving special nodes, if this is called any time besides
when walking in town mode, the special encounter ends immediately, and, if moving, the
party is not allowed to enter the space.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 186: Generic Button</dt><dd>A dialog box comes up saying the party has found a
button, and asking if they want to push it. The dialog buttons are Yes and No. If the No
button is pressed, the Jump To special is used. If the Yes button is pushed, the special
node specified in Extra 1b is called.</dd>

<dt>Type 187: Generic Stairway</dt><dd>A dialog box comes up saying the party has found a
stairway, and asking if they want to climb it. The dialog buttons are Climb and Leave. If
the Leave button is pressed, the Jump To special is used, and the party is not allowed to
enter the space. If the Climb button is pushed, the party is moved to another town.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space the party is to be
placed in in the new town.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of the town to place them in.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>Determines what text appears in the dialog. 0 - stairs up, 1 -
stairs down, 2 - path slopes up, 3 - path slopes down, 4 - slimy stairway up, 5 - slimy
stairway down, 6 - dark passage up, 7 - dark passage down, 8+ - no dialog (stairway
is forced).</dd>
<dt>Extra 2c:</dt><dd>If left at 0, the party can only enter while walking in town mode
(as described in the note for Generic Portal). If set to 1 or 2, the encounter can be
activated in combat mode. If set to 2 or 3, the encounter can be activated by other
actions, such as searching the space, using the space, targeting a spell on the space,
etc.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 188: Lever</dt><dd>A dialog box comes up with text you supply (saying, perhaps,
they've found a lever). The dialog buttons are Yes and No.
If the No button is pressed, the Jump To special is used.
If the Yes button is pushed, the terrain in the special space is turned to its Transform
To What type (if this special is called while looking or moving, not talking), and the
special node specified in Extra 1b is called.
<dl>
<dt>Mess 1:</dt><dd>The number of the first message to be displayed in the dialog box.
Press the Create/Edit button to edit the text.</dd>
<dt>Pict, Pictype:</dt><dd>This specifies the picture to display. To select a picture,
press the Choose Picture button.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The special node to call if Yes is pushed.</dd></dd>

<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space the party is
teleported to if the player pushes Enter.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Like all party moving special nodes, if this is called any time besides
when walking in town mode, the special encounter ends immediately, and, if moving, the
party is not allowed to enter the space.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 190: Stairway</dt><dd>A dialog comes up text you supply (saying, perhaps, they've
found a stairway). The dialog buttons are Climb and Leave.
If the Leave button is pressed, the Jump To special is
used, and the party is not allowed to enter the space. If the Climb button is pushed, the
party is moved to another town.
<dl>
<dt>Mess 1:</dt><dd>The number of the first message to be displayed in the dialog box.
Press the Create/Edit button to edit the text.</dd>
<dt>Pict, Pictype:</dt><dd>This specifies the picture to display. To select a picture,
press the Choose Picture button.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space the party is to be
placed in in the new town.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of the town to place them in.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If this is set to 1, the stairway is forced. No dialog box appears.
Instead, the party is immediately moved to the different level.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2c:</dt><dd>This has the same effect as on a Generic Stairway (see above for
details).</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 191: Relocate Outdoors</dt><dd>Changes the outdoors location of the party.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the outdoor section to place
the party in.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of their new location in that
sector (Range 0 ... 47, 0 ... 47)</dd>
<dt>Uses:</dt><dd>If, when the party leaves at the north end of a dungeon, you want them
to be in a different location in the outdoors from where they were when the entered, place
a special node of this type just before the north exit (where they're forced to step on
it).</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>When this node is called, there is a delay while the new outdoors
section is loaded into memory. Try not to call it too often.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 192: Place Item</dt><dd>Places an item on a specified space.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates of the space to place it on.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The number of the item to place. Press the Choose button to select
an item.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 193: Split Party</dt><dd>This powerful and unique special node splits up the
party. The player is asked to select a character. If the player hits Cancel, the node
special encounter ends immediately and the party is not allowed to enter the space.
Otherwise, the selected character is moved to a given spot and everyone else is left
behind. To later reunite the party, use the Reunite Party special node below.
<p>There are three rules when using this special. First, once the character is alone,
never let him or her leave town without reuniting with the party. Second, don't let the
character reach another Split Party node. Finally, always make it possible to reach a
Reunite Party node. Otherwise, the player will be stuck with only one character
permanently.
<p>If this node is called at any time besides in town mode, while walking or looking, the
special encounter ends immediately and this node is ignored.</p>
<p>When this node is used, if the player sends a PC off alone, the special encounter ends
immediately. Only if the player hits Cancel is the Jump To node used.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates to place the alone character
in.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 0, nothing else happens. If non-zero, a teleportation noise plays
when the party is split up.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt><dd>The three rules above are good guidelines to follow and were absolutely
necessary in the original version of the game. However, with the updated version, you
can break some of them if you really know what you're doing. The game now keeps track of
the town the split occurred in, so leaving town while split will not cause problems, but
you should make sure the party can't loop back around to where they split from (or reach
another Split Party node). Additionally, it's possible to use the Kill/Raise node to
reunite the party, instead of the Reunite Party node; however, you still need to call
Reunite Party with Extra 2a set to 1 so that the game stops tracking the location at
which they split up.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 194: Reunite Party</dt><dd>If the party is not split up, this node is ignored. If
the party is split up, the lone character is moved back to where the party was when it was
split up, the party is rejoined, and the special encounter ends.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If 0, nothing else happens. If non-zero, a teleportation noise plays
when the party is split up.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 0, the party is returned to where they split up at. Otherwise,
the party remains at their current location.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 195: Start Town Timer</dt><dd>One of the party's town encounter timers is
activated. Each move taken, the timer goes down by 1. When it runs out, a town special
node is called. If the party leaves town (even to go to a different dungeon level),
however, the timer cleared and no special happens.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of moves before the timer runs out. (Range 0 ...
30000)</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>The town special node to call when the timer runs out. If left at No
Special, nothing happens.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 196: Change Lighting Level</dt><dd>This node changes the current light level of
the town and/or party.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If left at -1, no change. Otherwise, set the lighting mode of the
town (the value normally set in Town Details).</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The amount by which to adjust the party's light level (as is
normally obtained from spells, lamps, etc).</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If 0, increase light level. Otherwise, decrease it.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 197: Set Attitude</dt><dd>Change the attitude of a single monster.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The number of the monster to affect. This is its unique ID within
the town, which is shown at the top right of the Edit Placed Creature dialog.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The new attitude.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 198: Centre on Space</dt><dd>Centres the terrain view on the specified space, as
if the player had selected the Look command and scrolled the view there. Note that, if you
want to show areas that would not be visible to the party from the current location, you
must also use the Lift Fog node.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The location to centre on. If either is -1, the view is
reset to centre on the active character.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 199: Lift Fog</dt><dd>Lift the fog of war so that spaces out of the party's line
of sight become fully visible. The fog is automatically restored at the end of the current
turn (after monsters make their move).
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>If 1, lift the fog. If 0, restore it.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>If needed, you can also use this to force the screen to be redrawn (just
specify the current fog setting).</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 200: Initiate Targeting Mode</dt><dd>This advanced node hooks into the native
Blades of Exile targeting engine to allow the player to select one or more targets. The
options are slightly different depending on whether the node is called during combat.
<p>When not in combat (ie, just wandering around town), it only supports selecting a
single target, and the rotateable wall area is not available. The player can select any
space in sight regardless of range.
<p>When in combat mode, the options increase. You can specify a maximum number of targets,
allowing the player to select several locations as with the Arrow spells. However, this
cannot be combined with the rotateable wall area, which is only supported in single-target
mode. You can also limit the player to selecting targets within a particular range.
<p>The special node sequence ends upon entering target mode. Once targeting is completed,
a new special node sequence begins, starting from the node specified in JumpTo. If
multiple targets were selected, this node sequence is repeated for each target. However,
if you chose an area other than single space, the sequence is called only for the location
clicked, not repeated for other locations within the covered area. If you want to affect
these additional locations, you must calculate them yourself. Since there is currently no
way to check which orientation of the rotateable wall was selected, there is not much
point in using it unless you are using one of the Place Pattern nodes to produce the
effect.
<p>The two Place Pattern nodes (below) automatically affect all spaces within the covered
area, and passing -1 as the pattern type means it uses the current pattern, which works
correctly even for the rotateable wall.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a:</dt><dd>The spell pattern to use.
0 - single space,
1 - 3x3 square,
2 - 2x2 square,
3 - 3x3 square excluding centre,
4 - circle radius 2,
5 - circle radius 3,
6 - 5 spaces in a cross,
7 - rotateable 2x8 wall</dd>
<dt>Extra 1b:</dt><dd>Maximum range (combat mode only)</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>Maximum number of targets (combat mode only)</dd>
<dt>JumpTo:</dt><dd>This node is called once for every selected target.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 201: Place Pattern (Fields/Objects)</dt><dd>Places fields according to a preset
spell pattern relative to a specified space.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>Key space of the pattern (usually the centre space).</dd>
<dt>Extra 1c:</dt><dd>The spell pattern to use.
-1 - use current pattern (only works when called through the Targeting Mode special node)
0 - single space,
1 - 3x3 square,
2 - 2x2 square,
3 - 3x3 square excluding centre,
4 - circle radius 2,
5 - circle radius 3,
6 - 5 spaces in a cross,
7-13 - rotateable 2x8 wall in various orientation</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a</dt><dd>The field type to place</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 202: Place Pattern (Direct Damage)</dt><dd>Deals damage according to a preset
spell pattern relative to a specified space.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b, Extra 1c:</dt><dd>Same as above node.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The type of damage to deal</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>The amount of damage to deal. This is the number of six-sided dice to roll to
calculate the damage.</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>If 0, it will animate each affected creature sequentially using simply booms,
similar to what happens when fields are placed and creatures take damage as a result. If
1, all damage will be animated simultaneously using fully-animated explosions, similar to
what happens when casting spells such as Fireball or Divine Thud.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 203: Relocate Creature</dt><dd>This node forces a single creature to relocate to
a different space. Useful for cutscenes. It can handle either absolute or relative
movement.
However, it does not currently check that it is legal for the creature to be on that
space.
This can split the party into its individual members temporarily, similar to combat mode,
but they return to the party's original location once the node sequence ends.
<dl>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The x and y coordinates or differentials.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>The creature to relocate - 0-5 for party members, 100+x for a
specific monster, -1 for the currently selected target.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If 0, Extra 1a and 1b are taken as absolute coordinates. If 1, they
are added to the x and y coordinates, respectively. 2 or 3 means the x coordinate is
instead subtracted, while 3 or 4 means the y coordinate is instead subtracted.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2c:</dt><dd>If positive, this specifies a delay in milliseconds after the
creature
is repositioned.</dd></dd>

<dt>Type 204:</dt><dd>This node places a text label on the terrain screen, for example to
indicate someone speaking. The label lasts only until the screen is next updated, but you
can optionally specify a delay to ensure there is time to read it.
<dl>
<dt>Mess 1:</dt><dd>The number of the message to display.</dd>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b:</dt><dd>The X and Y coordinates of the location to place the
message. If Extra 1b is left at -1, Extra 1a instead specifies the number of a creature at
whose location the message should be placed (0-5 for party members, 6 for party location,
100+x for other creatures). If both are left at -1, the current targeted PC from the
Select PC node is used.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2a:</dt><dd>If 1, the text is centred vertically on the space. If 0, it appears
at the top of the space.</dd>
<dt>Extra 2b:</dt><dd>If positive, this specifies a delay in seconds after the label is
placed.</dd></dd>
</dl>

<h4>Rectangle Specials:</h4>
<p>These nodes all do things to a rectangle of terrain that you select. Most of them work
both in town and outdoors, but the first few only work in town. For these nodes, the
values have slightly different meanings than before:</p>
<dt>Extra 1a, Extra 1b, Extra 2a, Extra 2b:</dt><dd>For each of these specials, Extra 1a
and Extra 1b are the top and left of the rectangle. Extra 2a and Extra 2b are the bottom
and right of the rectangle. Note that this is the reverse of standard coordinate order -
Y coordinate first, then X coordinate.	
<p>The default values of Extra 2a and Extra 2b are -1. If you want the effect to only
apply to one space (and not a whole rectangle), leave Extra 2a and Extra 2b at -1. In this
case, the node only affects the space specified by Extra 1a and Extra 1b.</dd>
<dt>Stuff done 1, Stuff done 2:</dt><dd>These are used differently than usual. Their
special meanings are described below.</dd>
<dt>Mess 1, Mess 2:</dt><dd>These can be used to display one or two messages when the node
is called, as usual. If both are left at -1, no message is displayed.</dd>
<dt>Pict:</dt><dd>If this is 0 (the default), the entire rectangle is affected. If
non-zero, only the outside edges of the rectangle are affected.</dd>

<dl>

<dt>Type 210: Place Field/Object/Sfx</dt><dd>Fills the rectangle with some sort of field,
barrier, object, or sfx. This only works in town.
<dl>
<dt>Stuff Done 1:</dt><dd>The percentage chance that each space will be filled with the
selected field type. (Range 0 ... 100) If you select 32 ("cleanse") as the field type,
however, this has a different meaning - 0 means that fire and force barriers, barrels,
crates, webs, and pushable stone blocks will be left alone, while 1 indicates they should
be erased.</dd>
<dt>Stuff Done 2:</dt><dd>The type of field (1 - force, 2 - fire, 3 - antimagic,
4 - stink, 5 - ice, 6 - blades, 7 - sleep, 15 - quickfire), object (8 - pushable stone block,
10 - web, 11 - crate, 12 - barrel, 13 - fire barrier, 14 - force barrier, 24 - forcecage),
or sfx (16 - sm blood, 17 - med blood, 18 - lg blood, 19 - sm slime, 20 - lg slime,
21 - ash, 22 - bones, 23 - stones) to place, or one of the special values (32 - cleanse,
33 - smash fragile walls like Move Mountains).</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Fields are never placed on spaces that contain walls, or other
impenetrable terrain.</dd>
<dt>Note:</dt><dd>Though you can place a forcecage around a creature using this, if you
