<h1>Section 3: Making and Editing Scenarios</h1>
<p>This chapter describes how to create a scenario, and how to edit the general scenario properties. As mentioned before, something marked (Advanced) can be ignored by people who arent interested in making more complicated scenarios.</p>

<h2>The File Menu</h2>

<p>You use the File menu to load new scenarios and save scenarios youve edited.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Open...</em> - Select this option to load in a new scenario.</li>
<li><em>Save</em> - This saves your changes.</li>
<li><em>New Scenario...</em> - This makes a new scenario.</li>
<li><em>Quit</em> - This closes the program. If youve made any changes, you will be asked if you would like to save first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenarios made in Macintosh and Windows are interchangeable. A scenario edited on the Mac can be run on a Windows machine, and vise versa.</p><!-- todo: check this -->

<h3>Creating a scenario</h3>

<p>When you make a new scenario, three dialog boxes will come up, asking you for information about the scenario to make:</p>

<p><b>First Dialog</b>: Enter the name of your scenario and the file name of the scenario (which must be at most eight characters long, all letters). To make the terrain for the surface be grass and mountains (as opposed to cave), press the small button. When done, press OK, or Cancel to stop the process.</p>

<p><b>Second Dialog</b>: Enter the width and height, in 48 x 48 sections, of the outdoors. This cant be changed later, so choose carefully (outdoor sections are small, so you may want to make it a little large than you think you will need).</p>
<p>In the second section, enter the number of towns the scenario will start with, of the three different sizes. The large towns will be placed first, followed by the medium towns followed by the small towns (so if you select 3 large towns and 3 small towns, towns 0 - 2 will be large, and 3 - 5 will be small). The exception to this is that if you want your scenario to be Warriors Grove, this will always be town 0.</p>
<p>Finally, select Include Starter Town to have one of your Medium Towns (town 0) be Warriors Grove, a pre-made town.</p>

<p><b>Third Dialog</b>: Enter a number from 0 to 30000. This will be the scenarios password, which must be entered before it can be edited. Leave at 0 to have no password. The password for the three scenarios that come with Blades of Exile are 100.</p>
<p>Be sure to write this down. If you forget it, you wont be able to edit your scenario. You may want to set it to 0 ... you can always change it later.</p>

<p>Finally, you will be asked for a final go-ahead, and your scenario will be built.</p>

<h2>The Scenario Menu</h2>

<p>A lot of things for your scenario are set using the Scenario menu.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Create New Town</em> - This tacks a new town onto the end of your scenarios town list. If you currently have 8 towns, for example, the new town will be town number 8 (your 9th town). Creating a new town is described later in this section.</li>
<li><em>Scenario Details</em> - This dialog sets the information the player will see when theyre choosing your scenario in the Custom Scenario Window in the game. You can set your scenarios version (it starts at 1.0.0), a brief description (each bit of text can be at most 60 characters long), contact information for you (such as an E-mail address), your scenarios rating (G to NC-17), and a guideline for how experienced the players party should be before they do your scenario. Note that you can't control the level of adventurers the player takes into your scenario. They are free to take as weak or powerful a party through as they want. All you can do is warn them how tough your scenario is in advance.</li>
<li><em>Scenario Intro Text</em> - Select this to edit the text the player will see when first entering your scenario, Press the Select Icon button to pick the graphic the player will see by your scenario when in the Custom Scenario Window.</li>
<li><em>Set Starting Location</em> - The scenario must have two starting locations. The first is the town the party will start in. The second is the location in the outdoors the party will be in with they leave that town. Select this to set the first location, the starting location in a town. Enter the number of the town to start in, and the starting location in that town.</li>
<li><em>Edit Special Nodes (Advanced)</em> - This moves you to the main screen, where all of the scenarios special nodes are listed to the right. Click on a node to edit it.</li>
<li><em>Edit Scenario Text (Advanced)</em> - This moves you to the main screen, where all of the scenarios text messages are listed to the right. Click on a message to edit it, or command click (right click in Windows) to clear it.</li>
<li><em>Import Town (Advanced)</em> - You can import a town from another scenario (or the same scenario). The town pulled in will be copied over the current town in memory. Aster selecting this option, you will be asked the number of the town to import, and then to select the scenario to import it from (you can select the scenario you are working on). Finally, you need to put in the password of the scenario you are opening. The scenario will be loaded in, and the selected town will be copied over your current town. the town selected must be of the same size (small, medium, large) as the current town.</li>
<li><em>Edit Saved Item Rectangle (Advanced)</em> - You can set three rectangles in towns where the partys items can be stored (i.e. they wont disappear when they leave town). Enter the number of the town, and the top, left, bottom, and right of the rectangle where the items will be remembered. To have no rectangle, leave the town number at -1. The three towns must be different.</li>
<li><em>Edit Horses (Advanced)</em> - The scenario can have up to 30 horses, which must all start in towns. Enter the number of the town the horse is in, and the horses location. If the horse isnt owned by the party, click on the button to the right. Press the arrows to edit other horses. When you place a boat in a scenario your party is already in, the boat does not actually appear in the scenario until the party enters a town. If the party is in a town, it won't appear until they leave the town and reenter.</li>
<li><em>Edit Boats (Advanced)</em> - The scenario can have up to 30 boats, which must all start in towns. They are edited the same way as the horses (above), and new boats don't appear until the party enters a town.</li>
<li><em>Set Variable Town Entry (Advanced)</em> - When they party enters a town, you can have the town they enter change, depending on the value of a Stuff Done Flag. Enter the number of the town, and the two parts of the Stuff Done flag to add to the town number when town 8 is entered. Example: Town 8 may be destroyed. When this happens, set Stuff Done Flag <tt>(3,4)</tt> to 1, have this flag added to town 8, and make the destroyed version of the town be town number 9.</li>
<li><em>Set Scenario Event Timers (Advanced)</em> - You can have a special node called every so many moves while the party is playing the scenario. Enter the interval between node calls on the left, and the number of the scenario special node to call on the right. Press the Create/Edit button to assign or edit the special node. Leave the time at -1 for no node to be called. Note that calling a special node takes some time. Dont set the interval too small, or your scenario wont play as well. The interval between calling a special node must be a multiple of 10 (such as 30, or 100, but not 55). Example: If the time is set to 100, and the node is set to 15, scenario special node 15 is called every 100 moves, no matter where the party is.</li>
<li><em>Edit Item Placement Shortcuts (Advanced)</em> - You can create 10 item placement shortcuts. This can enable you to place preset items in towns much more quickly. When Add Random Items is picked from the Town menu, the editor sorts through these shortcuts, and places random items on the terrain types you select. When editing a shortcut, first select a terrain type (press Choose to the upper right), and press the button to the left if you want the preset items to not be the partys property. Then select the items to place on a terrain type of this sort. Press one of the 10 Choose buttons below to pick an item, and then enter the percentage change (0 - 100) of the item being placed. Example: Suppose you want a pair of pants to appear in 25 percent of the dressers in a city. Press the Choose button by the terrain space and select Dresser. press one of the Choose buttons below, and select pants. Finally, enter a 25 in the chance spot.</li>
<li><em>Delete Last Town (Advanced)</em> - This deletes the last town in the scenarios town list. You cant delete the last town.</li>
<li><em>Write Data To Text File (Advanced)</em> - It is often convenient to have a list of all your scenarios terrain types and monsters. Select this, and lists of your terrain types, items, and monsters will be dumped into a text file titled Scenario data.</li>
<li><em>Do Full Text Dump (Advanced)</em> - It is also often very convenient to have a complete printout of all the text in a scenario, especially for proofreading. Select this, and all of the scenarios special messages will be dumped into a file titles Scenario Text. This will take a while - be patient.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making a New Town</h3>

<p>When you select Create New Town, a dialog box will come up asking for information on the town to create, which will then be added to the end of the current town list. The text area at the top is where you enter the name of the new town.</p>
<p>Click the button by the town size to select that size, and the button by the default terrain type to select the terrain the town will start with.</p>
<p>You will automatically be editing the new town. The scenario must be saved before you can create a new town.</p>
