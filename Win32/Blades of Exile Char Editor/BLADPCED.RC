 2735, "Poison"
 2736, "You will find poisons, which you can put on your weapons for a extra damage. Having a few levels in this skill will make it more likely you will put the poison on at full strength, and the less likely you will nick yourself with the poison accidentally."

 6006, "All boats and horses are now your property."
 6007, "Any major NPCs you may have slain, such as Erika or the dragons, are now alive again. You should now use the Leave Town and then Reset Towns menu items to make sure the characters appear."
 6008, "You are now considered a member of the Anama church. You can no longer cast Mage spells. To get the full effect of this, add Anama Rings above."

 6010, "If a job dispatcher is angry at you for making a late delivery, he/she has just forgiven you."

 6020, "Your save file no longer contains information on the towns you've visited. Monsters have reappeared, angry guards have forgotten you, etc. Note, if you are in town now, the game will still remember what happened in this town."
 6021, "The Tower of Magi timer is not currently running, so this will have no effect."
 6022, "You now have a bit more time before the Tower of Magi timer runs out. This time can be used to accumulate potions, train, and do other things to help you survive. Note that the Tower of Magi messages will eventually repeat themselves."
 6023, "If your characters became addicted to Skribbane herb, the addiction is now cured."
 6024, "You are now able to see all dungeons and towns, whether or not someone has told you about them."
