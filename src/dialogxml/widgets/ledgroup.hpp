/// A group of LED buttons that behave like radio buttons.
/// As with other standard LEDs, this always assumes red LEDs.
///
/// When an LED in the group is clicked, the following sequence of events are fired:
///
/// 1. The click handler of the clicked LED.
/// 2. The click handler of the LED group.
/// 3. The focus handler of the currently selected LED (if any), with the third parameter true.
/// 4. The focus handler of the clicked LED, with the third parameter false.
/// 5. The focus handler of the LED group, with the third parameter false.
///
/// If at any stage a handler returns false, the entire sequence is aborted, and the
/// selection is not changed. A click within the group's space but not on any choice
/// triggers no events.
/// @note When the focus handlers of the individual LEDs are called, the selection has not yet been updated,
/// so calling the LED group's getSelected() method will still return the previous selection.
/// However, when the focus handler of the LED group is called, the selection _has_ been updated.,
/// so getSelected() will return the new selection. (This is the reason for the getPreviousSelection() method.)
